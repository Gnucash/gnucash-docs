  <title>Investments</title>

  <para>This chapter explains how to manage your investments with &app;. Most people have an investment
    plan, whether its just putting money into a certificate of deposit (<acronym>CD</acronym> for short) account, investing through a company sponsored
    plan at your workplace or buying and selling stocks and bonds through a brokerage. &app; gives
    you tools to help you manage these investments such as the <emphasis>Price Database</emphasis>
    which allows you to record changes in the prices of stocks you own.

    <title>Basic Concepts</title>

    <para>An investment is something that you purchase in the hopes of generating income, or that you hope to
      sell in the future for more than you paid. Using this simple definition, many things could be
      considered investments: the house you live in, a valuable painting, stocks in publicly traded
      companies, your savings account at the bank, or a certificate of deposit. These many types of
      investments will be discussed in this chapter in terms of how to track them using &app;.

    <sect2 id="invest_terms2">
      <title>Terminology</title>

      <para>Before discussing investments specifically, it will be helpful to present a glossary of investment
        terminology. The terms presented below represent some of the basic concepts of investing. It
        is a good idea to become familiar with these terms, or at least, refer back to this list if
        you encounter an unfamiliar word in the later sections.

            <para>The difference between the purchase and selling prices of an investment. If the selling price is
              lower than the purchase price, this is called a <emphasis>capital loss</emphasis>.
              Also known as <emphasis>realized gain/loss</emphasis>.

            <para>Dividends are cash payments a company makes to shareholders. The amount of this payment is usually
              determined as some amount of the profits of the company. Note that not all common

            <para>What a borrower pays a lender for the use of their money. Normally, this is expressed in terms of a
              percentage of the principal per year. For example, a savings account with 1% interest
              (you are the lender, the bank is the borrower) will pay you $1 for every $100 you keep
              there per year.

          <listitem>
            <para>A measure of how easily convertible an investment is to cash. Money in a savings account is very
              liquid, while money invested in a house has low liquidity because it takes time to

          <listitem>
            <para>The probability that the return on investment is different from what was expected. Investments are
              often grouped on a scale from low risk (savings account, government bonds) to high
              risk (common stock, junk bonds). As a general rule of thumb, the higher the risk the
              higher the possible return.

          <listitem>
            <para>Occurs when a company offers to issue some additional multiple of shares for each existing stock.
              For example, a <quote>2 for 1</quote> stock split means that if you own 100 shares of
              a stock, you will receive an additional 100 at no cost to you. The unit price of the
              shares will be adjusted so there is no net change in the value, so in this example the
              price per share will be halved.

              Yield does not include capital gains or loses (see <xref linkend="invest_terms2.return" />). For example, a stock sells for $100
              and gives $2 in dividends per year has a yield of 2%.

      <title>Types of Investments</title>

      <para>Below is presented some of the broad types of investments available, and examples of each type.
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Interest-bearing account or instrument</emphasis>
          </para>

          <para>This type of investment usually allows you immediate access to your money, and will typically pay
            you interest every month based on the amount of money you have deposited. Examples are
            bank savings accounts (and some interest bearing checking accounts) and cash accounts at
            your brokerage. This is a very low risk investment, in the US these accounts are often
            insured against loss, to a specified limit.
          </para>

          <para>Sometimes an interest bearing investment is <emphasis>time-locked</emphasis>. This type of
            investment requires you to commit your money to be invested for a given period of time
            for which you receive a set rate of return. Usually, the longer you commit the higher
            the interest rates. If you withdraw your money before the maturity date, you will
            usually have to pay an early withdrawal penalty. This is a relatively lower risk
            investment. Examples are certificates of deposit or some government bonds. Other types
            of Bonds may have higher yields based on the higher risks from the quality of the
            issuer&rsquo;s <quote>credit rating</quote>.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Stocks and Mutual Funds</emphasis>
          </para>

          <para>This is an investment you make in a company, in which you effectively become a part owner. There is
            usually no time lock on publicly traded stock, however there may be changes in the tax
            rates you pay on capital gains depending on how long you hold the stock. Thus, stocks
            are typically quite liquid, you can access your money relatively quickly. This
            investment is a higher risk, as you have no guarantee on the future price of a stock.
          </para>

          <para>A mutual fund is a group investment mechanism in which you can buy into many stocks simultaneously.
            For example, a <quote>S&amp;P 500 index fund</quote> is a fund which purchases all 500 stocks listed
            in the Standard and Poor&rsquo;s index. When you buy a share of this fund, you are
            really buying a small amount of each of the 500 stocks contained within the fund. Mutual
            funds are treated exactly like a single stock, both for tax purposes and in accounting.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Fixed Assets</emphasis>
          </para>

          <para>Assets that increase in value over time are another form of investment. Examples include a house, a
            plot of land, or a valuable painting. This type of investment is very difficult to
            determine the value of until you sell it. The tax implications of selling these items is
            varied, depending on the item. For example, you may have tax relief from selling a house
            if it is your primary residence, but may not receive this tax break on an expensive
            painting.
          </para>

          <para>Fixed asset investments are discussed in <xref linkend="chapter_capgain" /> and
            <xref linkend="chapter_dep" />. Typically, there is not much to do in terms of
            accounting for fixed asset investments except recording the buying and selling
            transactions.

  <sect1 id="invest_accounts1">
    <title>Setting Up Accounts</title>

    <para>To setup investment accounts in &app; you can either use the predefined investment account hierarchy
      or create your own. The minimum you need to do to track investments is to setup an asset
      account for each type of investment you own. However, as we have seen in previous chapters, it
      is usually more logical to create a structured account hierarchy, grouping related investments
      together. For example, you may want to group all your publicly traded stocks under a parent
      account named after the brokerage firm you used to buy the stocks.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>Regardless of how you setup your account hierarchy, remember that you can always move accounts
        around later (without losing the work you&rsquo;ve put into them), so your initial account
        hierarchy does not have to be perfect.
      </para>
    </note>

    <sect2 id="invest_predefined2">
      <title>Using Predefined Investment Accounts</title>

      <para>The <guilabel>Investment Accounts</guilabel> option of the <guilabel>New Account Hierarchy
        Setup</guilabel> assistant will automatically create a basic investment account hierarchy
        for you. To access the predefined investment accounts hierarchy, you must make sure your
        &app; file is open, switch to the <guilabel>Accounts</guilabel> tab, and choose
        <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>Actions</guimenu><guimenuitem>New Account Hierarchy</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>.
        This will run the <guilabel>New Account Hierarchy Setup</guilabel> assistant and allow you
        to select additional accounts to add to your account hierarchy. Choose the
        <guilabel>Investment Accounts</guilabel> option (along with any others you are interested
        in). Assuming only investment accounts were selected, this will create an account hierarchy
        as shown below.
      </para>

        <para>You can also run the <guilabel>New Account Hierarchy Setup</guilabel> assistant by creating a new

    <sect2 id="invest_creating2">
      <title>Creating Investment Accounts Manually</title>

      <para>If you want to set up your own investment accounts hierarchy, you may of course do so. Investments
        usually have a number of associated accounts that need to be created: an asset account to
        track the investment itself; an income account to track dividend transactions; and expense
        accounts to track investment fees and commissions.
      </para>

      <para>In a typical account structure, security accounts are sub accounts of an asset account representing
        an account at a brokerage firm. The brokerage account would be denominated in your local
        currency and it would include sub accounts for each security that you trade there.
      </para>

      <para>Related purchases, sales, income and expense accounts should also be in the same currency as the
        brokerage account.
      </para>

      <para>The security sub accounts would each be configured to contain units of a single security selected
        from the master (user defined) security list and they are expected to use the same currency
        as the brokerage account.
      </para>

      <para>Security prices are kept in the <guilabel>Price Database</guilabel> of &app; (see <xref linkend="invest-stockprice1" />).
        This contains prices for individual securities (not security accounts). All prices for an
        individual security are in a single currency. If a security is traded in multiple
        currencies, then a separate security and separate accounts should be set up for each
        currency.

      <title>Custom Accounts Example</title>

      <para>The following is a somewhat more complicated example of setting up &app; to track your investments,
        which has the advantage that it groups each different investment under the brokerage that
        deals with the investments. This way it is easier to compare the statements you get from
        your brokerage with the accounts you have in &app; and spot where &app; differs from the
        statement.

    <title>Interest Bearing Accounts</title>

    <para>Investments which have a fixed or variable rate of interest are one of the simplest and most common
      form of investments available. Interest bearing investments include your bank account, a
      certificate of deposit, or any other kind of investment in which you receive interest from the
      principal. This section will describe how to handle these kinds of investments in &app;.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="invest_intacct2">
      <title>Account Setup</title>

      <para>When you purchase the interest bearing investment, you must create an asset account to record the
        purchase of the investment, an income account to record earnings from interest, and an
        expense account to record bank charges. Below is an account layout example, in which you
        have an interest bearing savings account and a certificate of deposit at your bank.

      <title>Example</title>

      <para>Now let&rsquo;s populate these accounts with real numbers. Let&rsquo;s assume that you start with
        $10,000 in your bank account, which pays 1% interest and you buy a $5,000 certificate of
        deposit with a 6 month maturity date and a 2% yield. Clearly, it is much better to keep your
        money in the certificate of deposit than in the savings account. After the initial purchase, your accounts
        should look something like this:

      <para>Now, during the course of the next 6 months, you receive monthly bank statements which describe the
        activity of your account. In our fictional example, we do nothing with the money at this
        bank, so the only activity is income from interest and bank charges. The monthly bank
        charges are $2. After 6 months, the register window for the certificate of deposit and for the savings account
        should look like these:

      <para>From the above image of the main &app; account window you see a nice summary of what happened to
        these investments over the 6 months. While the yield on the certificate of deposit is double that of the savings
        account, the return on the certificate of deposit was $50.21 versus $13.03 for the savings account, or almost 4
        times more. Why? Because of the pesky $2 bank charges that hit the savings account (which
        counted for $12 over 6 months).
      </para>

      <para>After this 6 month period, the certificate of deposit has reached maturity which means you may sell it with no early
        withdrawal penalty. To do so, simply transfer the $5,050.21 from the certificate of deposit account into the
        savings account.

    <para>Now that you have built an account hierarchy in the previous section, this section will show you how
      to create and populate the accounts with your investment portfolio. After this initial setup
      of your portfolio, you may have shares of stock purchased from before you started using &app;.
      For these stocks, follow the instructions in the
      <xref linkend="invest-buy-stock2" endterm="invest-buy-stock2.title" /> section.
      If you have just purchased your stocks, then use the

      <para>You should have within the top level <guilabel>Asset</guilabel> account, a few levels down, an

        on the <quote>right facing triangle marker</quote> signs next to the account names until the
        tree is opened to the depth of the new account. You will need to create a sub-account (of
        type <emphasis>stock</emphasis>) under the Stock account for every stock you own. Every
        stock is a separate account. The naming of these stock accounts is usually done using the
        stock ticker abbreviation, though account names may be anything that is clear to you and
        other users. So, for example, you could name your accounts <emphasis>AMZN</emphasis>,
        <emphasis>IBM</emphasis> and <emphasis>NST</emphasis> for your Amazon, IBM and NSTAR stocks

        </para>

        <para>&app; has a built-in lot management facility that can be used to keep track of capital gains or
          losses resulting from security sales. Buy and sell transactions are put into lots for the
          purpose of calculating the cost of the sale. More specifically, a lot is used to link
          particular buy and sell transaction splits. Lots can be automatically or manually created
          and linked. Capital gain or loss can be automatically calculated and transaction(s)
          created for the difference between the sale value and the cost of the securities sold.
          &app; refers to this process as <emphasis>scrubbing</emphasis>.
        </para>

        <para>The term <emphasis>scrub</emphasis> is used because security accounts need to be cleaned after sales
          to ensure the difference between the cost paid for securities, and value received from
          selling them, is accounted for as capital gain or loss. If the capital gain/loss is not
          correct, the <guimenuitem>Trial Balance</guimenuitem> bottom line total debits will not balance to total credits.
          To see the <guimenuitem>Trial Balance</guimenuitem>, select <menuchoice>
            <guimenu>Reports</guimenu> <guisubmenu>Income &amp; Expense</guisubmenu>

          </menuchoice>.        </para>

        <note>
          <para>If you make an error, you can delete the lot(s) and capital gain/loss transaction(s) and retry.
            Ensure you delete the lot, or at least unlink sale transactions from the lot, before you
            delete a capital gain/loss transaction. Otherwise, the <guilabel>Lots in
            Account</guilabel> screen will recreate the capital gain/loss transaction when you
            select the lot.

        <para>The &app; lot management facility can be a useful feature, reducing manual calculation, especially

          Advanced Portfolio Report basis costs and gains/losses will agree with the costs and

        <para>This functionality allows the manual linking of specific buy and sell transactions. It may be used in
          the case where a user wishes to use a different cost method than the automatic linking
          method (<acronym>FIFO</acronym>). Effectively, if one wishes the cost basis and capital gains in the Advanced
          Portfolio Report to be consistent with the capital gains transactions created by
          scrubbing, manual lot creation only needs to be used when using <acronym>LIFO</acronym> or <quote>sale of
          designated lots</quote> (the same thing for securities as far as US personal tax law is
          concerned). This is because the scrub function can automatically do <acronym>FIFO</acronym> linking so there
          is no need to do it manually and scrubbing cannot be used for average costing.

    <para>Some companies or mutual funds pay periodic dividends to shareholders. Dividends are typically given
      in one of two ways, either they are automatically reinvested into the commodity or they are
      given as cash. Mutual funds are often setup to automatically reinvest the dividend, while
      common stock dividends usually pay cash.

      <para>If the dividend is presented as cash, you should record the transaction in the asset account that
        received the money, as income from <emphasis>Income:Dividends</emphasis>. Additionally if

        split to the stock account with quantity 0 price 1 value 0.

      <para>As an example, assume you held AT&amp;T stock during the Nov. 18, 2005 merger of SBC with AT&amp;T.
        For this example you will have purchased AT&amp;T on April 1, 2005, any dividends will have
        been paid in cash, therefore not entered into the AT&amp;T stock register.
      </para>

      <para>The conditions of the merger were 0.77942 share of SBC stock were exchanged for each share of
        AT&amp;T stock. The merged company continued to use the symbol <quote>T</quote> from
        AT&amp;T.
      </para>

      <para>AT&amp;T paid a <quote>dividend</quote> of $1.20/share on the transaction date, however this will
        not appear in the stock account as it was a cash distribution.
      </para>

      <para>The process for entering this transaction is identical to the simple split until the
        <quote>Details</quote> screen. You will need to create an split entry in each
        <emphasis>Investment Account:Stock</emphasis> account combination that has shares splitting.
