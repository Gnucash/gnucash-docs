  <title>Business Features</title>

  <para>The accounting needs of a business are quite different from that of a person. Businesses have
    customers that owe money, vendors which are owed money, employee payroll, more complex tax laws,
    etc. &app; offers business oriented features to facilitate these needs.
  </para>

  <para>Accounts Receivable (A/R) are used by businesses to record sales for which they are not immediately
    paid. Accounts Payable (A/P) record bills that they have received, but might not pay until
    later. These types of accounts are used primarily when you have a lot of bills and receipts
    flowing in and out, and do not want to lose track of them just because you do not pay or get
    paid right away. For most home users, A/R and A/P are too complicated to be worth the effort.
  </para>

  <para>Accounts Receivable (or A/R) refers to products or services provided by your company for which
    payment has not yet been received. This is represented on the balance sheet as an asset, because
    the expectation is that you will receive payment soon.
  </para>

  <para>Accounts Payable (or A/P) refers to products or services bought by your company for which payment
    has not yet been sent. This is represented on the balance sheet as a liability because you will
    have to pay for them.
  </para>

    <title>Initial Setup</title>

    <para>To set up &app; to handle accounts receivable and accounts payable for a company the following
      preliminary steps must be done.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="busnss-setupacct2">
      <title>Account Setup</title>

      <para>There are many different ways to set up a business account hierarchy. You can start with the
        Business Accounts setup which is available from the New Account Hierarchy assistant, or you
        could build one manually. To access the prebuilt Business Accounts, start &app; and click on
        <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>New File</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>
        and proceed until you see the list of available accounts, select <emphasis>Business
        Accounts</emphasis>.
      </para>

      <note>
        <para>The prebuilt Business Account hierarchy will not meet your needs exactly. You will need to make
          adjustments for the hierarchy to function well with your particular situation. It should
          be close enough that it is recommended you begin with it.
        </para>
      </note>
<!--
      <para>To use &app;&rsquo;s integrated accounts
      payable system, you must first setup an account of the <emphasis>A/Payable</emphasis>
      type. The <emphasis>A/Payable</emphasis> account is usually a sub-account
      under Liabilities. It is within this account that the integrated A/P system
      places transactions.
      <screen>Basic A/P Account Hierarchy:

-Assets
  -Bank
-Liabilities
  -Accounts Payable
-Expenses
  -AP Expenses</screen>
</para>

     <para>You need to add additional asset accounts and real expense accounts to make
     this hierarchy useful.  The important aspects of this hierarchy are that you need
     an expense account and an Accounts Payable account, with account type set to
     <emphasis>A/Payable</emphasis>.</para>
