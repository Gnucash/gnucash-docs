    <para>When the Account Register Window for an account is opened the list of transactions for that account

        <para>The <keycap function="enter">Enter</keycap> key moves to the first field of the next split,
          regardless of which field you are in. If there is no next split, proceeds to the next

          <emphasis>CUR</emphasis> is the currency of the transaction.

        <para>The <keycap function="tab">Tab</keycap> key moves to the next field in the current split. If it's

      <para>The Scheduled Transactions Window is used to access the list of scheduled transactions and create,
        edit or remove them. It also provides a calendar which displays upcoming scheduled
        transactions. Clicking on the calendar view and hovering over any date will pop up a small
        dialog that shows the transactions scheduled for that day. The blue highlight in the
        calendar indicates which days have scheduled transactions. To dismiss the hover dialog click
        once more.
      </para>

      <para>The top pane of the Scheduled Transaction Window contains the list of scheduled transactions that
        are currently setup. This window lists the Name of the transaction, if the transaction is
        enabled for scheduling, the Frequency (month and day) that the transaction is to be entered,
        the last time the transaction was entered and the next time the transaction will be entered.
      </para>

      <para>The right side of this pane contains a down arrow button that when clicked will pull-down a window

        it is easy to see when the transactions are scheduled. Clicking on a date in the calendar
        brings up a list of scheduled transactions for that date. Moving the mouse over other dates

      area are specified with x = 0 at the left edge of the check with x increasing to the right,
      and y = 0 at the top edge of the check with y increasing as you travel down. (If you are using

        <para>The Import Matcher checks whether an imported transaction matches an existing transaction already
          recorded in <application>&appname;</application> within a predefined time window (~+_42
          days) for the account into which the transactions are being imported. A match probablity is
          calculated based on the Date, Amount, Transaction ID's (if present), Check numbers (if
          present) and the Description and split Memo fields. Exact matches will generate a high match
          probability and flag a transaction as matching an existing transaction and therefore not to
          be imported. If there is a lower quality match to an existing transaction, the imported
          transaction may be flagged for updating of non-matching information in the
          <application>&appname;</application> record of the matching transaction. These decisions can
          be overridden by the user.
        </para>

        <para>If no matching transaction can be identified the transaction will be flagged for import. The matcher
          will attempt to assign a transfer account based on matches between tokenized information for
          previously imported transactions stored in lists associated with the transfer accounts which
          were assigned to them on import.

              <para>If a good match is obtained, the transfer account is assigned and the transaction is flagged as

              <para>If a transfer account cannot be assigned, the transaction will be flagged for import and manual

                assigned, transactions will be assigned to an Imbalance account on import. This is to
                indicate that they need an appropriate account assigned to them.

    <para>Entering transactions in the General Journal is more complicated than entering them in the
      individual account registers. The advantage is the General Journal provides a more
      comprehensive view of the transactions you have entered in all your accounts.
    </para>

    <para>The General Journal defaults to showing only the previous month of transactions. This is changeable
      by using the "Filter By..." on the View menu.
