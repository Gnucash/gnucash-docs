  <title>The Basics</title>

  <para>This chapter will introduce some of the basics of using <application>&app;</application>. It is
  recommended that you read through this chapter, before starting to do any
  real work with <application>&app;</application>. Next chapters will begin to show

    <title>Accounting Concepts</title>

    <para><application>&app;</application> is easy enough to use that you do not need to have a
    complete understanding of accounting principles to find it useful.
    However, you will find that some basic accounting knowledge will prove to
    be invaluable as <application>&app;</application> was designed using these principles as a
    template. It is highly recommended that you understand this section of the
    guide before proceeding.</para>

      <title>The 5 Basic Accounts</title>

      <para>Basic accounting rules group all finance related things into 5
      fundamental types of <quote>accounts</quote>. That is, everything that
      accounting deals with can be placed into one of these 5 accounts:</para>

          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>

      <para>It is clear that it is possible to categorize your financial world
      into these 5 groups. For example, the cash in your bank account is an
      asset, your mortgage is a liability, your paycheck is income, and the
      cost of dinner last night is an expense.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="basics-accountingequation2">
      <title>The Accounting Equation</title>

      <para>With the 5 basic accounts defined, what is the relationship
      between them? How does one type of account affect the others? Firstly,
      equity is defined by assets and liability. That is, your net worth is
      calculated by subtracting your liabilities from your assets:</para>

      <para><emphasis>Assets - Liabilities = Equity</emphasis></para>

      <para>Furthermore, you can increase your equity through income, and
      decrease equity through expenses. This makes sense of course, when you
      receive a paycheck you become <quote>richer</quote> and when you pay for dinner you
      become <quote>poorer</quote>. This is expressed mathematically in what is known as
      the Accounting Equation:</para>

      <para><emphasis>Assets - Liabilities = Equity + (Income -
      Expenses)</emphasis></para>

      <para>This equation must always be balanced, a condition that can only
      be satisfied if you enter values to multiple accounts. For example: if
      you receive money in the form of income you must see an equal increase
      in your assets. As another example, you could have an increase in assets
      if you have a parallel increase in liabilities.</para>

      <title>Double Entry</title>

      <para>The accounting equation is the very heart of a <firstterm>double entry
      accounting system</firstterm>. For every change in value of one account in the
      Accounting Equation, there must be a balancing change in another. This
      concept is known as the <firstterm>Principle of Balance</firstterm>, and
      is of fundamental importance for understanding <application>&app;</application> and other double
      entry accounting systems. When you work with <application>&app;</application>, you will always be
      concerned with at least 2 accounts, to keep the accounting equation
      balanced.</para>

      <para>Balancing changes (or transfers of money) among accounts are
      done by debiting one account and simultaneously crediting another.
      Accounting <firstterm>debits</firstterm> and
      <firstterm>credits</firstterm> do not mean <quote>decrease</quote>
      and <quote>increase</quote>. Debits and credits each increase certain
      types of accounts and decrease others. In asset and expense accounts,
      debits increase the balance and credits decrease the balance. In
      liability, equity and income accounts, credits increase the balance
      and debits decrease the balance.</para>

      <para>In traditional double-entry accounting, the left column in the
      register is used for debits, while the right column is used for credits.
      Accountants record increases in asset and expense accounts on the
      debit (left) side, and they record increases in liability, revenue, and equity
      accounts on the credit (right) side. <application>&app;</application>
      follows this convention in the register.</para>

      <note>
        <para>This accounting terminology can be confusing to new users,
        which is why <application>&app;</application> allows you to use the
        common terms <guilabel>Deposit</guilabel> and
        <guilabel>Withdrawal</guilabel>. If you prefer the formal accounting
        terms, you can change the account register column headings to use
        them in the <guilabel>Accounts</guilabel> tab under
        <guilabel>Preferences</guilabel> (see the
        <application>&app;</application> Help Manual for more information on
        setting preferences).</para>
      </note>

      <warning>
        <para>Common use of the words <emphasis>debit</emphasis> and <emphasis>credit</emphasis>
        does not match how accountants use these words. In common use,
        <emphasis>credit</emphasis> generally has positive associations; in accounting,
        <emphasis>credit</emphasis> means
        <emphasis>affecting the right column</emphasis> of the ledger sheet of an account.
        This is associated with a <emphasis>decrease</emphasis> in asset and expense,
        but an <emphasis>increase</emphasis> of income, liability and equity accounts.</para>

  <sect1 id="basics-entry1">
    <title>Data Entry Concepts</title>

    <para>When entering data in <application>&app;</application>, you should be aware of the 3 levels
    of organization in which <application>&app;</application> divides your data: files, accounts and
    transactions. These levels are presented in their order of complexity, one
    file contains many accounts and one account contains many transactions.
    This division is fundamental to understanding how to use <application>&app;</application>.</para>

    <sect2 id="basics-files2">
      <title>Files</title>

      <para><application>&app;</application> stores information at the
      highest level in files. A file can be stored on your computer either
      as a single <acronym>XML</acronym> file (in all versions of
      <application>&app;</application>), or in a <acronym>SQL</acronym>
      database (in <application>&app;</application> version 2.4 and higher).</para>

      <note>
        <para><acronym>SQL</acronym> is pronounced <quote>sequel</quote>,
        so in spoken and written language we would say <quote>a SQL
        database</quote>.</para>
      </note>

      <para>With the <acronym>XML</acronym> file format,
      <application>&app;</application> stores your data in an
      <acronym>XML</acronym> data file, usually in compressed format
      (although this can be changed in the <guilabel>General</guilabel>
      tab of the <application>&app;</application> <guilabel>Preferences</guilabel>).</para>

      <para>With <acronym>SQL</acronym> storage,
      <application>&app;</application> stores your data in a
      <acronym>SQL</acronym> database under the database application you
      select (SQLite3, MySQL or PostgreSQL).</para>

      <para>You will need one main file or database for each set of
      accounts you are maintaining. To learn how to create and manage
      <application>&app;</application> files, see <xref
      linkend="basics-files1"/>.</para>

      <note>
        <para>If you think you might need more than one set of accounts,
        you might want to consult a professional accountant or bookkeeper
        before proceeding. Most users will probably have only one data
        file.</para>

    </sect2> <!-- basics-files2 -->
    <sect2 id="basics-accounts2">
      <title>Accounts</title>

      <para>An <firstterm>account</firstterm> keeps track of what you own,
      owe, spend or receive. Each <application>&app;</application> file can
      contain any number of accounts, and each account can contain many
      sub-accounts up to an arbitrary number of levels. This simple feature
      gives <application>&app;</application> much of its power in managing
      your finances, as you will see in later chapters.</para>

      <para>Examples of accounts include: checking accounts, savings
      accounts, credit card accounts, mortgages, and loans. Each
      <application>&app;</application> account tracks the activity for that
      <quote>real</quote> account, and can inform you of its status.</para>

      <para>In addition, accounts are also used to categorize the money you
      receive or spend. For example, you can create expense accounts to
      track the money you pay on utilities or groceries. Even though these
      are not accounts that receive statements, they allow you to determine
      how much money is being spent in each of these areas.</para>

      <para>Accounts will be covered in more detail in <xref
      linkend="chapter_accts"/>.</para>
    </sect2> <!-- basics-accounts2 -->
    <sect2 id="basics-transactions2">
      <title>Transactions</title>

      <para>A <firstterm>transaction</firstterm> represents the movement of
      money among accounts. Whenever you spend or receive money, or
      transfer money between accounts, that is a transaction.</para>

      <para>Examples of transactions are: paying a phone bill, transferring
      money from savings to checking, buying a pizza, withdrawing money,
      and depositing a paycheck. <xref linkend="chapter_txns"/> goes more
      in depth on how to enter transactions.</para>

      <para>In <link linkend="basics-accountingdouble2">double entry accounting</link>,
      transactions always involve at least two accounts&ndash;a source
      account and a destination account.
      <application>&app;</application> manages this by inserting a line
      into the transaction for every account that is affected, and
      recording the amounts involved in each line. A line within a
      transaction that records the account and amount of money involved is
      called a <firstterm>split</firstterm>. A transaction can contain an
      arbitrary number of splits.</para>

Each open window (which can include account registers, reports, or Scheduled Transactions windows) is given a tab on this bar that you can click to view that window. Tabs can be configured in Preferences to appear along any side of the <application>&app;</application> window.</para>

    <para>To see the full name for a tab, hover the mouse pointer over an account window tab.</para>

    <para>If more screens are open than can be displayed across the screen, some tabs
        will not display.  You can move through all tabs by clicking the arrows on
        either end of the tab bar. A complete list of tabs can be viewed by
        right-clicking the Tab Bar and any tab can be selected by clicking it.</para>

    <sect2 id="basics-options2">
      <title>Menu Items</title>

      <para>The account tree window and the account register window both
      contain menu headings in a <emphasis>Menubar</emphasis>. Clicking on a menu heading brings
      up the menu items for that heading.</para>

      <para>You can click on the account tree menu headings and then move the
      mouse pointer over the menu items to see what they do. As the pointer
      moves over a menu item, a description of the item appears in the lower
      left-hand corner of the window (inside the <emphasis>Statusbar</emphasis>). To select a menu item, click on
      it.</para>

      <para>You can also access the most common menu items in a window by
      right-clicking the mouse anywhere in that window. In the account tree
      window, this will bring up a list of account items. In the account
      register window, this will bring up a list of transaction items.</para>

      <para>Other ways of accessing menu items are through keyboard shortcuts
      and access keys, described next.</para> </sect2>

    <sect2 id="basics-shortcut2">
      <title>Menu Shortcuts</title>

      <para>All of the menu items have access keys which are
      marked by underlined characters in the menu names. Pressing the
      <keycap>Alt</keycap> key with the underlined character in the menu
      heading will bring up the menu items for that heading. Once the menu
      items are displayed, type the underlined character in the menu item to
      activate it. For example, typing <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap>
      <keycap>F</keycap></keycombo> in the main window brings up the <guimenu>File</guimenu>
      menu, then typing <keycap>S</keycap> will save the file.  Access keys
      are fixed and cannot be changed by users.</para>

      <para>Some of the more commonly used menu items also have shortcut keys
      that directly activate the command without having to traverse the menu
      structure.  These shortcuts typically use the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
      key, although they can use any key combination.  Menu shortcuts are
      displayed at the end of each menu item.</para>

	<sect2 id="basics-files1-overview">
		<title>Overview</title>
		
		<para><application>&app;</application> offers several formats for storing 
		your financial data. The default file storage format is <acronym>XML</acronym>, 
		while <acronym>SQL</acronym> storage is available in SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL 
		formats. Users can choose a file format for new files from <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu> 
		<guimenuitem>Save </guimenuitem></menuchoice> and for existing files from <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu> 
		<guimenuitem>Save As...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> dialogs.</para>
		
		<para>The <acronym>XML</acronym> storage format is a text file that by default is compressed, 
		which is a preference that is set at <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu> 
		<guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem></menuchoice> <guilabel>General</guilabel> 
		<guilabel>Compress files</guilabel>. SQLite storage is also available, and stores 
		your data in a single file on your system, like the <acronym>XML</acronym> format. However,
		internally, an SQLite file is managed as a database. The MySQL and PostgreSQL storage options 
		require access to a MySQL or PostgreSQL database server and the installation of 
		additional database drivers on your machine.</para>
		
		<note>
		<para>Users can change the format at any time by using <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu> 
		<guimenuitem>Save As...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. This will create a copy of 
		the data file in the selected format.</para>
		</note>

	<sect2 id="basics-files-storage-comparison">
		<title>Storage Comparison and Recommendations</title>
		<para>Each storage format has benefits and shortcomings that users should 
		consider for their needs and abilities. See the Storage Comparison Table below 
		for further details.</para>
		
		<para>The <acronym>XML</acronym> format is the most stable and established, 
		and for this reason, it is recommended for most users. <acronym>SQL</acronym>
		storage was added for the 2.4 release and has become an increasingly popular 
		choice for users, but can require experience with <acronym>DBMS</acronym> 
		applications.</para>
			
		<note>
			<para>Use of a <acronym>SQL</acronym> back end for storage implies to many 
			that <application>&app;</application> has fully implemented <acronym>DBMS</acronym> 
			features, including multi-user and incremental data manipulation.  However, 
			<application>&app;</application> does not currently implement these features, 
			although it is a long term goal of the development team. </para>

    accounting data, or you might need to follow accounting guidelines that require you to close your books at the end
    of the year and begin each year with a fresh set of books.</para>

    <para><application>&app;</application> allows you to create an empty copy of your Chart of Accounts simply by selecting
    <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guisubmenu>Export</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Export Accounts</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
    When you select this command, you are asked to provide the name for the new empty file, and <application>&app;</application>
    creates a new data file that contains only your account hierarchy (that is, there is no transaction data).
    Once saved, the new file can be opened like any other <application>&app;</application> data file as described above.</para>

      <title>Backup file (.gnucash)</title>

      <para>Each time you save your data file, a backup copy will also be
      saved with the extension <filename>.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.gnucash</filename>. This backup file is a complete copy of
      your previous data file, and the filename format refers to the data
      file, year, month, day and time of the backup. For example, the filename
      <filename>myfile.gnucash.20100414185747.gnucash</filename> indicates this is a
      backup copy of the file <filename>myfile</filename> saved in the year
      2010, April 14, at 6:57:47 p.m.</para>

      <para>To restore an old backup file, simply open the <filename>.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.gnucash</filename> file with the
      date to which you wish to return. Be sure to save this file under a
      different name.</para>

      <note>
       <para>
         <filename>.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.xac</filename> instead of the actual extension <filename>.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.gnucash</filename>.
         So if you upgrade from the 2.2 series to the 2.4 series, you may end up with both <filename>.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.xac</filename>

      <title>Log file (.log)</title>

      <para>Each time you open and edit a file in <application>&app;</application>,
      <application>&app;</application> creates a log file of changes you have made to your data file.
      The log file uses a similar naming format as the backup files:
      <filename>.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.log</filename>. Log files
      are not a full backup of your data file - they simply record changes you
      have made to the data file in the current <application>&app;</application> session.</para>

      <para>In case you exit <application>&app;</application> inadvertently, possibly due to a power
      outage or a system wide crash, it is possible to recover most of your
      work since the last time you saved your <application>&app;</application> file using this log
      file. This is the procedure:</para>

          and select the one .log file with the same date as the saved file

          you will possibly wreak havoc in your accounts.</para>

      <para>Log replaying will recover any transaction affecting the balance

      transactions and business features (invoices, bills, etc.).</para>

      <warning>
        <para>Changes to the scheduled transactions, invoices or
        bills themselves are NOT recovered, and their transactions that were
        recovered may not be properly associated with them, and should thus be
        double-checked. Especially for business transactions, you may have to
        delete and re-create some of them. If you do not, although the balance
        will be correct, some reports may not.</para>

      <title>Lock files (.LNK and .LCK)</title>

      <para>You may occasionally see <filename>.LNK</filename> and <filename>.LCK</filename> files appear. These do not
      store any data, but they are created to prevent more than one user from
      opening the same file at the same time. These files are automatically
      created when you open the file, to lock it so no one else can access it.
      When you close your <application>&app;</application> session or open another file, <application>&app;</application>
      unlocks the first data file by deleting the <filename>.LCK</filename> and <filename>.LNK</filename> files.</para>

      <para>If <application>&app;</application> crashes while you have a data file open, the <filename>.LCK</filename> and
      <filename>.LNK</filename> files are not deleted. The next time you try to open <application>&app;</application>, you
      will get a warning message that the file is locked. The warning message
      appears because the <filename>.LNK</filename> and <filename>.LCK</filename> files are still in your directory. It is
      safe to choose <guibutton>Yes</guibutton> to open the file, but you should delete the <filename>.LNK</filename> and
      <filename>.LCK</filename> files (using a terminal window or your file manager). Once those
      files are deleted, you will not get the warning message again unless
      <application>&app;</application> crashes.</para>

      <title>File Management</title>

      <para>So which files should you keep around? Keep your main data file,
      of course. It&rsquo;s a
      good idea to keep some of the more recent <filename>.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.gnucash</filename> backup files, but you can safely
      delete the <filename>.log</filename> files since they are not complete copies of your data.</para>

      <note>
        <para>If you upgraded from a <application>&app;</application> version prior to 2.4, you may also have backup files
        in the old <filename>.xac</filename> format. For these files you can apply the same principle described above for
        <filename>.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.gnucash</filename> backup files.</para>
      </note>

      <para>You should also delete any <filename>.LCK</filename> and <filename>.LNK</filename> files that you see after
      closing <application>&app;</application>. If you decide to back up your data file to another

      backup files.</para>

      <note>
        <para>By default <application>&app;</application> will automatically delete any <filename>.log</filename> and <filename>.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.gnucash</filename>
