  <title>Multiple Currencies</title>
  <para>This chapter will show how to set up &app; accounts to use multiple currencies. 
  </para>
  <sect1 id="currency_concepts1">
    <title>Basic Concepts</title>
    <para>&app; supports over a hundred currencies, from the Andorran Franc to the Zimbabwe Dollar.
      For example, you can have a bank account set up in Euros, and another using Hong Kong Dollars.
    </para>
    <para>Some of the issues which arise when using multiple currencies are, how do you transfer
      funds between accounts with different currencies? How do you calculate the overall value when
      you have mixed currency accounts? How do reports deal with mixed currencies?
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        An alternative way to manage multiple currency accounts from the one presented in the next
        sections, is to use the
        <guilabel>trading</guilabel>
        accounts capabilities of &app;. This feature, which was introduced with &app; version
        2.3.14, can be enabled by going to the
        <guilabel>Accounts</guilabel>
        tab under
        <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>File</guimenu>
          <guimenuitem> Properties</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>
        .
      </para>
      <para>
        For a complete guide on
        <guilabel>trading</guilabel>
        accounts, see
        <ulink url="http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/accounting/tutorial.html">this tutorial by Peter Selinger

        .
      </para>
    </note>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="currency_acct1">
    <title>Account Setup</title>
    <para>
      Your default account currency is set in the
      <guilabel>Account</guilabel>
      tab under
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
      (
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>&appname;</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
      on MacOS).
    </para>
    <para>Similarly,
      &app; offers an option to set your preferred currency for displaying reports (like the balance
      sheet and income statement). The option is called
      <guilabel>Default Report Currency</guilabel>
      , and is in the
      <guilabel>Reports</guilabel>
      tab of the
      <guilabel>&appname; Preferences</guilabel>
      screen. You&rsquo;ll want to set both options when you start using &app; because if (for
      example) your accounts are all in Canadian Dollars but the generated reports are all in US
      Dollars, the reports will just say that there are
      <quote>no data/transactions (or only zeroes) for the selected time period</quote>
      .
    </para>
    <para>When you create a new account, you have the option to define the commodity in which that
      account is denominated. For accounts denominated in a currency, you can specify any of the
      currencies supported by &app; by simply selecting it from the currency commodity list. You
      will notice that the default currency is the currency that is defined for the parent account
      of the new account. 
    </para>
    <para>As an example, let&rsquo;s set up a bank account scenario where you mostly work in US
      Dollars, but do also have a European bank account using the Euro currency, as well as one bank
      account in Hong Kong using Hong Kong Dollars. So, set up 3 bank accounts, one denominated in
      US Dollars, one using Euros, and the third in Hong Kong Dollars. One possible account
      structure for this would be: 
    </para>
    <literallayout>
-Assets (USD)
   -Current Assets (USD)
      -US Bank (USD)
      -European Bank (EUR)
      -HK Bank (HKD)
-Equity (USD)
   -Opening Balances (USD)
      -USD (USD)
      -EUR (EUR)
      -HKD (HKD)

Note: the currency of each account is shown in parenthesis.
    </literallayout>
    <para>Since in this example you mostly work in USD, all of the parent accounts are set to USD.
      Of course, if you mostly work in Euros, you could change the currency of these parent accounts
      to EUR. The totals shown in the account tree window will always be converted to the currency
      of each particular account. Notice, we also set up 3 Starting Balances equity accounts, used
      to initially populate the 3 banks.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        You could also set up just a single Starting Balance account and use a currency transfer to
        populate the
        <quote>different currency</quote>
        accounts. However, this is more advanced option, which is explained in a later section (
        <xref linkend="currency_purchase2" />
        ).
      </para>
    </note>
    <para>Below
      you see the result of this example, in which you start with USD 10,000, EUR 10,000 as well as
      HKD 10,000 in the three bank accounts. Notice that the total of the parent accounts only shows
      the value of the currency of sub-accounts with matching currencies. In other words, the Total
      Assets and Total Equity values only reflect USD amounts, because &app; has no way of
      evaluating the value of EUR or HKD yet. Once you set up exchange rates between the currencies,
      the parent accounts will calculate the converted value of all sub-accounts. See the later
      section (
      <xref linkend="currency_howto1" />
      ) on ways to do this.

      <title>User-Defined Currencies</title>
      <para>
        Usually when we talk about currencies, we mean government-backed currencies (or more
        precisely, currencies defined in
        <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217">ISO 4217</ulink>).
        &app; does not allow you to create your own currencies. If you want to track non-
        <acronym>ISO</acronym>
        currencies, you can use either of two workarounds, depending on which fits your needs
        better.
      </para>
      <para>
        The
        <emphasis role="strong">first method</emphasis>
        is to treat these as if they were a security&mdash;that is, like a stock or mutual fund. The
        second method is to use one of the
        <quote>dummy</quote>
        currencies for them.
      </para>
      <para>Let&rsquo;s
        say for example that you want to track loyalty points you&rsquo;ve earned by buying from a
        certain group of businesses. The account which tracks your loyalty points will be
        <emphasis>Assets:Other:LoyaltyGroupRewardMiles</emphasis>
        .
      </para>
      <para>
        In the first method, you define a new security, of type
        <guilabel>FUND</guilabel>,
        called RewardMiles. This is pretty straightforward&mdash;when you create the new
        <emphasis>LoyaltyGroupRewardMiles</emphasis>
        account, just set the account type to
        <guilabel>Stock</guilabel>
        or
        <guilabel>Mutual Fund</guilabel>
        , click the
        <guibutton>Select...</guibutton>
        button next to the
        <guilabel>Security/currency:</guilabel>
        box, and click
        <guibutton>New</guibutton>
        to define a new security of type
        <guilabel>FUND</guilabel>
        .
      </para>
      <para>This
        is not really what the stock and mutual fund account types are meant for, but &app; will
        allow it. The downside is that you&rsquo;ll have to enter a
        <quote>price</quote>
        for every transaction involving this account, because &app; needs the prices to figure out
        the monetary value of the points and treat them as one of your assets. 
      </para>
      <para>
        In the
        <emphasis role="strong">second method</emphasis>
        , you use one of the dummy currencies to track the loyalty points. These currencies are
        <quote>XTS (Code for testing purposes)</quote>
        and
        <quote>XXX (No currency)</quote>.
        If you use one of these for your LoyaltyGroupRewardMiles account, you can enter transactions
        into the account without having to enter share prices for every transaction. And, you can
        keep using the same two dummy currencies to track all sorts of amounts&mdash;vacation
        dollars earned and used so far this year, vacation hours earned and used, health insurance
        benefits allowance used and remaining, and so on. 
      </para>
      <para>
        The drawback with this second method is that you cannot define exchange rates for the dummy
        currencies to convert them to
        <acronym>ISO</acronym>
        currencies. If you want to do that, you really should use the first method.

    <title>Recording and Updating Currency Exchange Rates</title>

      &app; allows you to update the Currency Exchange Rates both manually and automatically. This
      process is essentially the same as setting share prices for investments (see
      <xref linkend="invest-stockprice1" />
      ). In the following two sections we will work through both methods.

    <title>Recording Purchases in a Foreign Currency</title>
    <para>Purchases in a foreign currency can be managed in two different ways.</para>
    <para>1) Use &app;'s built-in currency exchange functions when you do your transactions. This is
      mainly used for one-time transactions, and nothing which happens regularly. 
    </para>
    <para>2) Use separate accounts to track transactions, where all involved accounts use the same
      currency. This is the recommended method, since it allows much better tracking and follow up.
      In this way, you do one currency exchange transaction, and after that you do normal
      transactions in the native currency.

      <para>You are using USD as your default currency. But, you decide to purchase a boat in
        Jamaica. To do this, you opened a bank account in Jamaica, moved some money from the US, and
        then purchased your boat.
      </para>
      <para>To record this in &app; we use the following basic account structure:

      -US Bank (USD)
      -Jamaican Bank (JMD)

-Equity (USD)
   -Opening Balances (USD)
      -USD (USD)

Note: the currency of each account is shown in parenthesis.

      <para>First you need to transfer some money ($10,000) to Jamaica, and you use your US bank
        account (with a balance of $100,000) for that. The bank gives you an exchange rate of USD 1
