  <title>Investments</title>

  <para>This chapter explains how to manage your investments with <application>&app;</application>.
  Most people have an investment plan, whether its just putting money into a
  CD account, investing through a company sponsored plan at your workplace or
  buying and selling stocks and bonds through a brokerage. <application>&app;</application> gives you
  tools to help you manage these investments such as the <emphasis>Price
  Editor </emphasis> which allows you to record changes in the prices of
  stocks you own.</para>

  <sect1 id="invest_concepts1">
    <title>Basic Concepts</title>

    <para>An investment is something that you purchase in the hopes of
    generating income, or that you hope to sell in the future for more than
    you paid. Using this simple definition, many things could be considered
    investments: the house you live in, a valuable painting, stocks in
    publicly traded companies, your savings account at the bank, or a
    certificate of deposit. These many types of investments will be discussed
    in this chapter in terms of how to track them using <application>&app;</application>.</para>

    <sect2 id="invest_terms2">
      <title>Terminology</title>

      <para>Before discussing investments specifically, it will be helpful to
      present a glossary of investment terminology. The terms presented below
      represent some of the basic concepts of investing. It is a good idea to
      become familiar with these terms, or at least, refer back to this list
      if you encounter an unfamiliar word in the later sections.</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><emphasis>Capital gains</emphasis></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The difference between
          the purchase and selling prices of an investment. If the selling
          price is lower than the purchase price, this is called a
          <emphasis>capital loss</emphasis>. Also known as <emphasis>realized
          gain/loss</emphasis>.</para>

        <term><emphasis>Common stock</emphasis></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>A security that
          represents a certain fractional ownership of a company. This is what
          you buy when you <quote>buy stock</quote> in a company on the open market. This
          is also sometimes known as <emphasis>capital

      <varlistentry>
        <term><emphasis>Compounding</emphasis></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The concept that the
          reinvested interest can later earn interest of its own (interest on
          interest). This is often referred to as <emphasis>compound

      <varlistentry>
        <term><emphasis>Dividends</emphasis></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Dividends are cash payments a company
          makes to shareholders. The amount of this payment is usually
          determined as some amount of the profits of the company. Note that
          not all common stocks give dividends.</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><emphasis>Equities</emphasis></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Equities are investments in which the

          <para>What a borrower pays a lender
          for the use of their money. Normally, this is expressed in terms of
          a percentage of the principal per year. For example, a savings
          account with 1% interest (you are the lender, the bank is the
          borrower) will pay you $1 for every $100 you keep there per
          year.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>The probability that the return
          on investment is different from what was expected. Investments are
          often grouped on a scale from low risk (savings account, government
          bonds) to high risk (common stock, junk bonds). As a general rule of
          thumb, the higher the risk the higher the possible return.</para>

          <para>Occurs when a company offers
          to issue some additional multiple of shares for each existing stock.
          For example, a <quote>2 for 1</quote> stock split means that if you own 100
          shares of a stock, you will receive an additional 100 at no cost to
          you. The unit price of the shares will be adjusted so there is no
          net change in the value, so in this example the price per share will
          be halved.</para>

          <para>A measure of the amount of money

    <sect2 id="invest_types2">
      <title>Types of Investments</title>

      <para>Below is presented some of the broad types of investments
      available, and examples of each type.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Interest-bearing account or
          instrument</emphasis></para>

          <para>This type of investment usually allows you immediate access to
          your money, and will typically pay you interest every month based on
          the amount of money you have deposited. Examples are bank savings
          accounts (and some interest bearing checking accounts) and cash
          accounts at your brokerage. This is a very low risk investment, in
          the US these accounts are often insured against loss, to a specified
          limit.</para>

          <para>Sometimes an interest bearing investment is
          <emphasis>time-locked</emphasis>. This type of investment requires
          you to commit your money to be invested for a given period of time
          for which you receive a set rate of return. Usually, the longer you
          commit the higher the interest rates. If you withdraw your money
          before the maturity date, you will usually have to pay an early
          withdrawal penalty. This is a relatively lower risk investment.
          Examples are certificates of deposit or some government bonds. Other
          types of Bonds may have higher yields based on the higher risks from
          the quality of the issuer&rsquo;s <quote>credit rating</quote>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Stocks and Mutual Funds</emphasis></para>

          <para>This is an investment you make in a company, in which you
          effectively become a part owner. There is usually no time lock on
          publicly traded stock, however there may be changes in the tax rates
          you pay on capital gains depending on how long you hold the stock.
          Thus, stocks are typically quite liquid, you can access your money
          relatively quickly. This investment is a higher risk, as you have no
          guarantee on the future price of a stock.</para>

          <para>A mutual fund is a group investment mechanism in which you can
          buy into many stocks simultaneously. For example, a "S&amp;P 500
          index fund" is a fund which purchases all 500 stocks listed in the
          Standard and Poor&rsquo;s index. When you buy a share of this fund, you
          are really buying a small amount of each of the 500 stocks contained
          within the fund. Mutual funds are treated exactly like a single
          stock, both for tax purposes and in accounting.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Fixed Assets</emphasis></para>

          <para>Assets that increase in value over time are another form of
          investment. Examples include a house, a plot of land, or a valuable
          painting. This type of investment is very difficult to determine the
          value of until you sell it. The tax implications of selling these
          items is varied, depending on the item. For example, you may have
          tax relief from selling a house if it is your primary residence, but
          may would not receive this tax break on an expensive
          painting.</para>

          <para>Fixed asset investments are discussed in <xref linkend="chapter_capgain" /> and 
          <xref linkend="chapter_dep" />. Typically, there is not much to do
          in terms of accounting for fixed asset investments except recording
          the buying and selling transactions.</para>

  <sect1 id="invest_accounts1">
    <title>Setting Up Accounts</title>

    <para>To setup investment accounts in <application>&app;</application> you can either use the
    predefined investment account hierarchy or create your own. The minimum
    you need to do to track investments is to setup an asset account for each
    type of investment you own. However, as we have seen in previous chapters,
    it is usually more logical to create a structured account hierarchy,
    grouping related investments together. For example, you may want to group
    all your publicly traded stocks under a parent account named after the
    brokerage firm you used to buy the stocks.</para>

    <note>
    <para>Regardless of how you setup your account hierarchy, remember that
    you can always move accounts around later (without losing the work you&rsquo;ve
    put into them), so your initial account hierarchy does not have to be
    perfect.</para>
    </note>

    <sect2 id="invest_predefined2">
      <title>Using Predefined Investment Accounts</title>

      <para>The <guilabel>Investment Accounts</guilabel> option of the
      <guilabel>New Account Hierarchy Setup</guilabel> assistant will
      automatically create a basic investment account hierarchy for you. To

      <menuchoice><guimenu>Actions</guimenu><guimenuitem>New Account

      <title>Creating Investment Accounts Manually</title>

      <para>If you want to set up your own investment accounts hierarchy,
      you may of course do so. Investments usually have a number of
      associated accounts that need to be created: an asset account to
      track the investment itself; an income account to track dividend
      transactions; and expense accounts to track investment fees and
      commissions.</para>

      <para>In a typical account structure, security accounts are sub accounts
        of an asset account representing an account at a brokerage firm. The
        brokerage account would be denominated in your local currency and it
        would include sub accounts for each security that you trade there.
      </para>

      <para>Related purchases, sales, income and expense accounts should also
        be in the same currency as the brokerage account.
      </para>

      <para>The security sub accounts would each be configured to contain units
        of a single security selected from the master (user defined) security
        list and they are expected to use the same currency as the brokerage
        account.
      </para>

      <para>Security prices are kept in a separate area of <application>&app;
        </application> (the Price Database - <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools
        </guimenu><guimenuitem>Price Editor</guimenuitem></menuchoice>). This
        contains prices for individual securities (not security accounts). All
        prices for an individual security are in a single currency. If a 
        security is traded in multiple currencies, then a separate security and
        separate accounts should be set up of each currency.

    <title>Interest Bearing Accounts</title>

    <para>Investments which have a fixed or variable rate of interest are one
    of the simplest and most common form of investments available. Interest
    bearing investments include your bank account, a certificate of deposit,
    or any other kind of investment in which you receive interest from the
    principal. This section will describe how to handle these kinds of
    investments in <application>&app;</application>.</para>

    <sect2 id="invest_intacct2">
      <title>Account Setup</title>

      <para>When you purchase the interest bearing investment, you must create
      an asset account to record the purchase of the investment, an income
      account to record earnings from interest, and an expense account to
      record bank charges. Below is an account layout example, in which you
      have an interest bearing savings account and a certificate of deposit at
      your bank.</para>

      and you buy a $5000 certificate of deposit with a 6 month maturity date
      and a 2% yield. Clearly, it is much better to keep your money in the CD
      than in the savings account. After the initial purchase, your accounts

      <para>Now, during the course of the next 6 month, you receive monthly
      bank statements which describe the activity of your account. In our
      fictional example, we do nothing with the money at this bank, so the
      only activity is income from interest and bank charges. The monthly bank
      charges are $2. After 6 months, the register window for the CD and for the savings 
      account should look like these:</para>

      <para>From the above image of the main <application>&app;</application> account window you see a
      nice summary of what happened to these investments over the 6 months.
      While the yield on the CD is double that of the savings account, the
      return on the CD was $50.21 versus $13.03 for the savings account, or
      almost 4 times more. Why? Because of the pesky $2 bank charges that hit
      the savings account (which counted for $12 over 6 months).</para>

      <para>After this 6 month period, the CD has reached maturity which means
      you may sell it with no early withdrawal penalty. To do so, simply
      transfer the $5050.21 from the CD account into the savings
      account.</para>

    <para>Now that you have built an account hierarchy in the previous
    section, this section will show you how to create and populate the accounts with your
    investment portfolio. After this initial setup of your portfolio, you may have
    shares of stock purchased from before you started using <application>&app;</application>. For these stocks,
    follow the instructions in the <link linkend="invest-buy-stock2"><emphasis>Entering
    Preexisting Shares</emphasis></link> section below. If you have just purchased your stocks,
    then use the <link linkend="invest-buy-new2"><emphasis>Buying New Shares</emphasis>

      <para>You should have within the top level <guilabel>Asset</guilabel>

      to the account names until the tree is opened to the depth of the new
      account. You will need to create a sub-account (of type
      <emphasis>stock</emphasis>) under the Stock account for every stock you
      own. Every stock is a separate account. The naming of these stock
      accounts is usually done using the stock ticker abbreviation, though account
      names may be anything that is clear to you and other users. So, for
      example, you could name your accounts <emphasis>AMZN</emphasis>,

      an additional sub-account would be necessary.</para>

      <para>Now for the transaction, on the first transaction line, enter the date of

      Shares will be skipped (to be calculated), Price (eg: $96.60), and Buy ($5000).
      You do not need to fill in the <guilabel>Shares</guilabel> column, as it will be
      calculated for you. The next line in the split transaction will be

    <para>Entering an investment you are selling is done in the same way as
    buying one (see <xref linkend="invest-buy-new2" />) except the total cost 
    of the transaction is entered in the
    <emphasis>Sell</emphasis> column and the <emphasis>Shares</emphasis>
    column is entered as a negative amount. The net proceeds from the sale
    should be transferred from the stock account to your bank or brokerage
    account.</para>

    <para>The proper recording of the stock sale *must* be done using a split
    transaction. In the split transaction, you must account for the profit (or
    loss) as coming from an <emphasis>Income:Capital Gains</emphasis> account 
    (or <emphasis>Expenses:Capital Loss</emphasis>). To balance this income,
    you will need to enter the stock asset
    twice in the split. Once to record the actual sale (using the correct
    number of shares and correct price per share) and once to balance the
    income profit (setting the number of shares to 0 and price per share to
    0).</para>

    <note>
      <para>In order to get <application>&app;</application> to commit this
      zero-share, zero-price split to the transaction, you *must* 
      <keycap>Tab</keycap> out of the split. If you use the 
      <keycap function="enter">Enter</keycap> key, <application>&app;</application>
      will convert the split into shares of the commodity.</para>
    </note>

    <para>In the split transaction scheme presented below, the symbol
    NUM_SHARES is the number of shares you are selling, SELL_PRICE is the
    price for which you sold the shares, GROSS_SALE is the total price for
    which you sold shares, equal to NUM_SHARES*SELL_PRICE. PROFIT is the
    amount of money you made on the sale. COMMISSIONS are the brokerage
    commissions. NET_SALE is the net amount of money received from the sale,
    equal to GROSS_SALE - COMMISSIONS.</para>

        scrubbing, when referring to investments, involves creating lots
        linking sell transaction splits to buy transaction splits, and then 
        creating a gain/loss transaction for the difference between the sale
        value and the cost of the securities sold. This can be a useful feature
        reducing manual calculation especially if dividends have been
        reinvested over years and there are many different costs involved
        in a sale.
      </para>

      <para>The term <emphasis>scrub</emphasis> is used because security
        accounts need to be cleaned up after sales to ensure the 
        difference between the cost paid for securities, and value
        received from selling them, is accounted for as capital gain or

              pointless (other than for the automatic creation of the gain/loss

                    split because gains on investments, in some jurisdictions,
                    may be taxed at different rates depending on how long they
                    were held before being sold. As a separate capital gains
                    transaction is created for each lot, this makes it easier to
                    determine tax on the capital gains based on the lot opened

                  <para>If you know that the capital gains from a

                    1 capital gains transaction.

                    It is also possible to manually link multiple sell

                    a capital gains transaction per sell transaction split
                    based on the average cost of securities held at the time of
                    each sale, assuming acquisitions are allocated to sales
                    using the security account costing method (currently only
                    FIFO). As this makes it complicated to manually verify the
                    costs are correct, it may be wise to limit this to specific
                    situations, say for example if there are multiple sales on
                    the same day.

    <para>Some companies or mutual funds pay periodic dividends to
    shareholders. Dividends are typically given in one of two ways, either

<!--  Stock Splits - Simple

-->

  <sect1 id="invest-splitsnmergers1">
    <title>Splits and Mergers</title>

    <para>Companies may split their stock for many reasons but the most common
    is that the price has risen higher than management thinks is a reasonable price for
    many investors. Some of these splits are simple exchanges (eg 2 for 1 or 3 for 2)
    and some are complex exchanges with cash distributions.  Splits may also result in
    fewer shares if the exchange rate is a reverse split (1 for 3 or .75 for 1).
