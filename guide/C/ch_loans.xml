  <title>Loans</title>

  <para>This chapter explains how to manage your loans with &app;.
  </para>

  <sect1 id="loans_concepts1">
    <title>Basic Concepts</title>

    <para>A loan is defined as a financial transaction in which someone pays for the use of someone
      else&rsquo;s money. There are many familiar examples of loans: credits cards, auto loans,
      house mortgages, or a business loan.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="loans_conceptsterms2">
      <title>Terminology</title>

      <para>Before discussing tracking loan in &app; specifically, it will be helpful to present a glossary of
        terminology. The terms presented below represent some of the basic concepts found concerning
        loans. It is a good idea to become familiar with these terms, or at least, refer back to
        this list if you encounter an unfamiliar word in the later sections.
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Amortization</emphasis> - the repayment plan which will insure that a loan is eventually
            paid off, typically utilizing equal valued monthly payments. These payments are usually
            split into principal and interest, where the amount of principal per payment increases
            (and interest decreases) as the amortization period elapses.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Borrower</emphasis> - the person or company that receives the money from a loan.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Default</emphasis> - when a borrower fails to repay a loan according to the terms agreed
            upon with the lender.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Deferment</emphasis> - a temporary delay in the repayment of a loan.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Delinquency</emphasis> - is the term that refers to late payments.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Disbursement</emphasis> - amount of the loan paid to the borrower. Some loans have
            multiple disbursements, meaning the borrower does not receive the full amount of the
            loan at one time.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Interest</emphasis> - the expense charged by the lender to the borrower for the use of the
            money loaned. This is typically expressed in terms of a yearly percentage charged on the
            principal borrowed, known as the <emphasis>Annual Percentage Rate</emphasis> or APR.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Lender</emphasis> - the company or person who lends money to a borrower.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Loan Fee</emphasis> - a processing fee removed from the principal at the time the borrower
            receives a loan.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Principal</emphasis> - the original amount of the loan, or the amount of the original loan
            that is still owed. When you make a monthly payment on a loan, part of the money pays
            the interest, and part pays the principal.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Promissory Note</emphasis> - the legal agreement between the borrower and lender
            concerning the loan.

  <sect1 id="loans_accounts1">
    <title>Setting Up Accounts</title>

    <para>When a borrower obtains a loan, it is usually with the intention to make a purchase of something of
      value. In fact, most loans require the borrower to buy some predetermined asset, such as a
      house. This asset is insurance against the borrower defaulting on the loan. There are, of
      course, examples of loans which do not necessarily have an associated high value asset, such
      as educational loans.
    </para>

    <para>For the account structure presented here, we will assume the loan was used to purchase a
      compensating asset.
    </para>

    <para>A loan is a liability, the interest you accrue on the loan is an on-going expense, and any
      administrative fees you may have to pay would be another expense. The thing purchased with the
      money from a loan is an asset. With these parameters, we can now present a basic loan account
      structure:
    </para>

      <title>Advanced: Calculation Details</title>

      <para>In order to discuss the mathematical formulas used by the <guilabel>Loan Repayment
        Calculator</guilabel>, we first must define some variables.
<screen>
 n   == number of payment periods
 %i  == nominal interest rate, NAR, charged
 PV  == Present Value
 PMT == Periodic Payment
 FV  == Future Value
 CF  == Compounding Frequency per year
 PF  == Payment Frequency per year

Normal values for CF and PF are:
   1  == annual
   2  == semi-annual
   3  == tri-annual
   4  == quaterly
   6  == bi-monthly
  12  == monthly

        <title>Converting between nominal and effective interest rate</title>

        <para>When a solution for n, PV, PMT or FV is required, the nominal interest rate (i) must first be
          converted to the effective interest rate per payment period (ieff). This rate, ieff, is
          then used to compute the selected variable. When a solution for i is required, the
          computation produces the effective interest rate (ieff). Thus, we need functions which
          convert from i to ieff, and from ieff to i.
        </para>
<screen>To convert from i to ieff, the following expressions are used:
Discrete Interest:   <emphasis>ieff = (1 + i/CF)^(CF/PF) - 1</emphasis>
Continuous Interest: <emphasis>ieff = e^(i/PF) - 1 = exp(i/PF) - 1</emphasis>

To convert from ieff to i, the following expressions are used:
Discrete Interst:    <emphasis>i = CF*[(1+ieff)^(PF/CF) - 1]</emphasis>
Continuous Interest: <emphasis>i = ln[(1+ieff)^PF]</emphasis></screen>
        <note>

        <title>The basic financial equation</title>

        <para>One equation fundamentally links all the 5 variables. This is known as the fundamental financial
          equation:
        </para>
<screen>
<emphasis>PV*(1 + i)^n + PMT*(1 + iX)*[(1+i)^n - 1]/i + FV = 0</emphasis>

  Where: X = 0 for end of period payments, and
         X = 1 for beginning of period payments</screen>
        <para>From this equation, functions which solve for the individual variables can be derived. For a
          detailed explanation of the derivation of this equation, see the comments in the file
          <ulink url="https://github.com/Gnucash/gnucash/blob/maint/libgnucash/app-utils/calculation/fin.c"><filename>&file-finc;</filename></ulink> from the &app; source code. The A, B, and C variables are defined
          first, to make the later equations simpler to read.
        </para>
<screen>
<emphasis>A = (1 + i)^n - 1</emphasis>
<emphasis>B = (1 + iX)/i</emphasis>
<emphasis>C = PMT*B</emphasis>

<emphasis>n = ln[(C - FV)/(C + PV)]/ln((1 + i)</emphasis>

<emphasis>PMT = -[FV + PV*(A + 1)]/[A*B]</emphasis>
<emphasis>FV = -[PV + A*(PV + C)] </emphasis>

The solution for interest is broken into two cases.
The simple case for when  PMT == 0 gives the solution:
<emphasis>i = [FV/PV]^(1/n) - 1</emphasis>
</screen>
        <para>The case where PMT != 0 is fairly complex and will not be presented here. Rather than involving an
          exactly solvable function, determining the interest rate when PMT !=0 involves an
          iterative process. Please see the <filename>&file-finc;</filename> source file for a detailed
          explanation.

      <sect3 id="loans_calcsdetails_ex2">
        <title>Example: Monthly Payments</title>

        <para>Let&rsquo;s recalculate <xref linkend="loans_calcsexample1_2"/>, this time using the mathematical
          formulas rather than the <guilabel>Loan Repayment Calculator</guilabel>. What is your
          monthly payment on a $100,000 30 year loan at a fixed rate of 4% compounded monthly?
        </para>

        <para>First, let&rsquo;s define the variables: n = (30*12) = 360, PV = 100000, PMT = unknown, FV = 0, i =
          4%=4/100=0.04, CF = PF = 12, X = 0 (end of payment periods).
        </para>

        <para>The second step is to convert the nominal interest rate (i) to the effective interest rate (ieff).
          Since the interest rate is compounded monthly, it is discrete, and we use: ieff = (1 +
          i/CF)^(CF/PF) - 1, which gives ieff = (1 + 0.04/12)^(12/12) - 1, thus ieff = 1/300 =
          0.0033333.
        </para>

        <para>Now we can calculate A and B. A = (1 + i)^n - 1 = (1 + 1/300)^360 - 1 = 2.313498. B = (1 + iX)/i =
          (1 + (1/300)*0)/(1/300) = 300.
        </para>

        <para>With A and B, we can calculate PMT. PMT = -[FV + PV*(A + 1)]/[A*B] = -[0 + 100000*(2.313498 + 1)] /
          [2.313498 * 300] = -331349.8 / 694.0494 = -477.415296 = -477.42.

    <title>A Personal Loan to a friend (How-To)</title>

    <para>It is not always you are borrowing money from the bank, sometimes you borrow money from your family,
      or perhaps even lend money to a friend. This How-To chapter will describe one way to handle
      lending money to a friend.
    </para>

    <para>We are basing this How-To on the following generic account structure.
    </para>
<screen>
-Asset
   -Bank
        -Bank Account
   -Money owed to you
        -Person
-Income
   -Interest Income
        -Person</screen>
    <para>This example will show how to track a personal loan of 2,000 USD (default currency) to your friend
      Peter.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="loans_personalLoanToSomeOne_loan">
      <title>Loan Specifications</title>

      <para>Peter wants to borrow $2,000 dollars from you and plans to pay you back monthly for the next 18
        months. Since he is your friend, (but not that close) you both agree on a yearly interest
        rate of 5%.
      </para>

      <para>In summary we have the below details. Peter&rsquo;s loan details:
        <itemizedlist>

        </itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>So how do you calculate the Monthly Payment?
      </para>

      <para>You have a number of different options, like paper and pen, &lin; Calculator, <application>OpenOffice.org</application>
        Calc module, but the easiest is to use &app; <link linkend="loans_calcs1"><guilabel>Loan
        Repayment Calculator</guilabel></link>. This tells you that the Monthly Payment should be
        $115.56.
      </para>

      <para>But you need to know how much of this is Interest and how much is Principal to be able to do a
        proper bookkeeping. For this you need a more powerful tool, something like the
        <application>Calc</application> module in <application>OpenOffice.org</application>, and in
        particular the <acronym>PMT</acronym> function.

      <title>A More Complex Transaction</title>

      <para>In this example, we will touch a little on some more complicated accounting principles. For more
        details on this subject, please check <xref linkend="chapter_capgain"></xref>.
      </para>

      <para>Here we will only touch on the case when you have accurately estimated the current value of your
        house. For the other cases (over-, and under-estimated), please check
        <xref linkend="chapter_capgain"></xref>.

        -House</screen>
      </para>

      <para>You bought a house for $300,000 once upon a time, and over the years kept a close look on the market
        and updated your records with the estimated current value of your house. At the time you
        want to sell it, you have determined that the current market value is $600,000.
      </para>

      <para>The difference between $600,000 (estimated market value) and $300,000 (purchase value) is the
        current Unrealized Gain value. Therefore you have a total of $300,000 in your
        <emphasis>Assets:Fixed Assets:House:Unrealized Gain</emphasis> account
      </para>

      <para>How do you record this sell transaction?
      </para>

      <para>To record this you need to increase your Saving account with the $600,000, and decrease some other
        accounts with $600,000. You must first change from unrealized gain to realized gain for your
        <emphasis>Income</emphasis> accounts. Lastly you need to transfer the full amounts from the
        <emphasis>Assets:Fixed Assets:House</emphasis> sub-accounts.
      </para>

      <para>The transaction you enter into your <emphasis>Income:Realized Gain:House</emphasis> account
        should look like this.
