          <para><emphasis>Double Entry</emphasis>: Every transaction must
          debit one account and credit others by an equal amount. This ensures

    <title>Top Ten Reasons to Use <application>&app;</application></title>

    <para>We&rsquo;ve already discussed some of the general advantages of using
    <application>&app;</application>. Here are some specific features offered by <application>&app;</application> that may not
    exist in other programs.</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Simple user interface</para>

        <para><application>&app;</application> is as easy to use as a checkbook register. It&rsquo;s simpler
        than a paper register, because auto-completion and other entry
        shortcuts not only do work for you, but reduce data entry
        errors.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Easy import</para>

        <para><application>&app;</application> allows you to import data from on-line bank statements
        and software packages using <acronym>QIF</acronym> (<trademark
        class="registered">Quicken</trademark> Interchange Format), <acronym>OFX</acronym> and
        <acronym>HBCI</acronym> files. An easy-to-use <quote>assistant</quote> walks you through
        reviewing resulting changes and actually importing them into
        <application>&app;</application>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Statement reconciliation</para>

        <para>Reconcile monthly statements quickly by entering the statement
        ending balance and checking off transactions. <application>&app;</application> helps you catch
        any discrepancies between your data and statements you receive.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Investment tracking</para>

        <para><application>&app;</application> offers a host of ways to track your investment
        portfolio. Special investment accounts simplify data entry, and
        on-line tools allow you to update prices of your holdings as the
        markets change. Reports complete the picture, allowing you to analyze
        your investment decisions.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Multiple currency support</para>

        <para><application>&app;</application> allows you to track multiple currencies. If you have
        bank accounts, investments or other financial data in different
        currencies, use <application>&app;</application> to monitor them.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Customized reports and graphs</para>

        <para>Reports and graphs give you valuable information for filing

      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Double entry</para>

        <para>To provide complete records, <application>&app;</application> uses the double entry
        method of bookkeeping. Double entry simply means that money doesn&rsquo;t
        just appear or disappear - an equal amount must come from one location
        and go to another location. By tracking the transaction in both
        locations, <application>&app;</application> will give you detailed reports from the perspective
        of either account.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Sources of help</para>

        fill in the rest! You can also use copy, paste and duplicate functions
        to save typing time. Keyboard shortcuts let you quickly choose a menu
        option or to enter numerical data. Many numeric entry fields can act
        as a calculator: enter "92.18+33.26" and watch <application>&app;</application> input the
        corresponding sum for you!</para>
      </listitem>
