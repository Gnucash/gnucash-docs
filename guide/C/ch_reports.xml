 <title>Reports</title>
 <para><application>&app;</application> is a powerful double entry accounting software package that allows 
users to enter and track their money in a reliable manner. However, putting 
this information into <application>&app;</application> is only a part of the process. To be truly 
helpful, you need to be able to extract this information in meaningful ways. 
<application>&app;</application>'s reporting features allow you to just that.</para>
<para><application>&app;</application>'s reporting features allow you to display nearly any group of 
transactions in a wide variety of formats. This makes it easy to answer 
questions about your finances, such as "How much did I spend on groceries 
last month?" or "How much did I earn in the previous six months?"</para>
<para><application>&app;</application> includes a number of common report types, which can be modified to 
meet your specific needs. If these common reports are insufficient, it is 
possible to modify or even write your own custom reports (although this is 
not recommended for beginners).</para>

 <sect1 id="rpt_concepts">
 <title>Overview</title>
 <para>There are many standard reports pre-built in <application>&app;</application>, 
 all available from the <guimenu>Reports</guimenu> pulldown menu in the main account window.</para>
 <para>When you select a report from the list of reports, that report is first run 
 with its default settings. Once you have opened the report, you can modify its parameters by clicking on 
the Options button on the toolbar. Under Options, you will see the different 
settings that you can change for each report. Note that for different reports, 
the options will be different. </para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="rpt_savedconfigsinfo">
  <title>Saved Reports Configurations Concepts</title>
  <para>Once you have modified a report to meet your needs, you may wish to save 
  that report for reuse at a later point. <application>&app;</application> allows custom 
  reports to be saved, using the Save Report Configuration command.</para>
  <para>To save a report configuration:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Go to the Reports Menu and choose the desired report.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Change the settings on the report until it includes what is needed.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Go to the General tab of the report's options and change the Report Name 
to something meaningful (Do not confuse this with the Report Title).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Apply the changes and close the dialog.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Click the Save Report Configuration or Save Report Configuration As... button</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>This will store the report options in a file in your home directory.</para>
<para>The first time you save a report with a name that has not already been saved, 
you can use either the Save Report Configuration or the Save Report 
Configuration As... button. You can modify the report name before saving it.</para>
<para>Once a report has been saved with the current name, the Save Report Configuration button will immediately update the saved report configuration. 
Use the Save Report Configuration As button to save the current report 
configuration with a new name.</para>
<para>Saved report configurations are available for use under the 
Reports->Saved Report Configurations entry. They will also be available for 
use on multicolumn reports.</para>
<para>Saved report configurations can be deleted in the Saved Report Configurations 
dialog by clicking the trashcan icon.</para>
<para>To edit saved report configurations, open the report via Reports->Saved Report 
Configurations, edit and apply the new options, and click Save Report 
Configuration.</para>

<sect1 id="rpt_standardrpts">
  <title>Standard Reports Overview</title>
 <para>The standard reports that are included in <application>&app;</application> are presented here 
 in the order that they appear in the <guimenu>Reports</guimenu> menu. In each section, a short 
 description for each report is given, which explains what the report is 
 intended to show, and its primary purpose.</para>

<sect2 id="rpt_grp_assetsliabs">
<title>Assets &amp; Liabilities Group</title>
<para>Reports in this group provide general information about assets and liabilities.</para>

<sect3 id="rpt_advport">
<title>Advanced Portfolio</title>
<para>The Advanced Portfolio produces a report on commodity accounts 
(stock and mutual fund type accounts) using price information stored in the 
<application>&app;</application> price database and within the 
<application>&app;</application> transaction data. If you do not have stock 
price information in your file, the report will indicate an error. This report 
includes extended information about commodity holdings, including information 
about the basis, gain, and return of individual commodities.</para>

  <sect4 id="rpt-advport-capgains">
    <title>Advanced Portfolio Capital Gains</title>
    <para>
      The Advanced Portfolio report doesn’t use the capital gain splits to
      calculate capital gains. It calculates the gains from the various buy and
      sell transactions in the account without regard to whether the gains and
      losses are recorded or not. Any realized gain splits are ignored.
      Realized gain splits are recognized as two splits,  one in the stock’s
      account with a zero number of shares and a non-zero value, the other in an
      income account with a value that is the negative of the split in the stock
      account. These two splits can be in a separate transaction (as created by
      scrubbing) or in the same transaction as the sale (this will cause 
      incorrect future scrubbing).
    </para>
      
    <para>Thus, if you wish to subclassify capital gains, say into taxable or
      non taxable, do this as a transfer, say from Capital Gains to 
      Capital Gains Taxable and Capital Gain Non Taxable in a separate 
      transaction which does not include a split to the stock's account.

<sect3 id="rpt_custsummary">
<title>Customer Summary</title>
<para>Customer Summary is a customer profit report that can help with job analysis by 
comparing the income and expenses for a specific customer.</para>
<para>All invoices have an Owner in <application>&app;</application>, so invoices that are 
made will show a customer and show in the report. When creating a Bill, the Default 
Chargeback Customer is blank. To use the profit report, this field needs an entry, 
since this is the tag that decides the line to which 
to attach the expense. Left blank, the bill will be assigned to "No Customer."
Similarly, when income is entered directly in a register rather than creating an 
invoice, it will also be assigned to "No Customer."</para>
<para>Thus, if this report includes an entry for "No Customer", this means that the report 
may be inaccurate, as the results are not all properly labeled.</para>
<para>Possible use scenarios include:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Tracking retail sales from different cities</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Tracking rental properties</para></listitem> 
<listitem><para>Tracking types of business</para></listitem> 
<listitem><para>Tracking commission sales</para></listitem> 
</itemizedlist>
<para>Each of these scenarios assumes that the account structure includes breakdowns
for individual tracked categories. Changing settings on the Income and Expense 
tabs under Options can hone the information displayed. By default all income and 
expense accounts are included; however, since <application>&app;</application> can't really predict 
the names and classification of income and expense accounts, it must group them all
into the "No Customer" entry.</para>
<para>Note that inventory-based businesses won't benefit from this report because of its nature.</para>
<para>Useful options:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The Expense Accounts tab allows the selection of one or more expense accounts.</para></listitem>
