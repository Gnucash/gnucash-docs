  <glossterm>Stock split</glossterm>
  <glossdef>
    <para>Occurs when a company offers to issue some additional multiple of shares 
    for each existing stock. For example, a <quote>2 for 1</quote> stock split 
    means that if you own 100 shares of a stock, you will receive an additional 
    100 shares at no cost to you. The unit price of the shares will usually be 
    adjusted  so there is no net change in the value, so in this example the 
    price per share will be halved. Note that such transactions affect the cost
