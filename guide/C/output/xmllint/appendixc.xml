    <para>(Box n) refers to VAT form box number (I actually have these as
descriptions to the account to remind me)</para>
    <para>Add all the (Box n -part)  together to get the whole (Box n)
The VAT shows you liability - if its negative they owe you.</para>
    <para>Capital Equipment (Box 7 - part) and (Box 6 - part) is the value of all *additions* (purchases) made over the VAT return period - not the absolute value, nor the difference in value unless that difference is wholly due to new purchases. Depreciation, losses (e.g a write off of faulty item) and other reductions in capital value are not included. If you sell a capital item then that sale and its VAT is recorded under Income. The asset is <quote>converted to cash</quote>, so the <quote>net of VAT</quote> increase in your bank account, when the invoice is payed, is matched by a decrease in capital.</para>
