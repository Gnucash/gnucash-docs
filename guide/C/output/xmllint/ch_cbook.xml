<chapter id="chapter_cbook">
  <title>Checkbook</title>
  <para>This chapter will give you all the specific information you need to
  manage your checkbook with &app;. Managing your checkbook register is the
  first step of tracking your finances, and &app; makes it much easier to
  manage than the traditional paper register does.</para>
  <para>For one thing, as discussed in <xref linkend="chapter_txns"/>,
  data entry of common
  transactions is practically done for you in &app;, because of its
  auto-completion feature. &app; keeps a running balance of each account,
  and it makes reconciling these accounts easy. And the double-entry method
  helps you account for your spending by requiring a transfer account for
  withdrawals, so you can easily find out how much money you spend in
  different areas.</para>
  <para>Once you are comfortable with using &app; for your checking and
  other bank accounts, you may wish to continue on with tracking other
  financial accounts. Chapters 6 through 9 examine methods to manage your
  other accounts.</para>
  <sect1 id="cbook-accounts1">
    <title>Setting up Accounts</title>
    <para>The first step in managing your checkbook is to set up the necessary
    accounts. You can either use the default &app; accounts or set up your
    own. For more detail on how to set up a new account, refer to
    <xref linkend="accts-examples-toplevel2"/>.
    For instructions on importing your accounts from another program, refer to the
    &app; manual.</para>
    <para>Let&rsquo;s start with the bank accounts you&rsquo;ll need. You need one &app;
    bank type account for each physical bank account you wish to track. If you
    are setting up your own accounts or using the default &app; accounts,
    make sure that you have an opening balance transaction for each bank
    account you own. The easiest way to get this number is to use the balance
    from your last bank statement as your opening balance. You can enter this
    in the account information window automatically as part of the
    <guilabel>New Account Hierarchy Setup</guilabel> assistant, or you can enter a
    manual transaction directly in the account. To enter the transaction
    manually, enter a transfer from an <guilabel>Opening Balances</guilabel>
    account (type equity) to the bank account.</para>
    <para>The typical bank accounts you might track include:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Checking - any institutional account that provides check-writing
        privileges.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Savings - an interest-bearing institutional account usually used
        to hold money for a longer term than checking accounts.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Common transactions that affect these bank accounts are payments and
    deposits. <emphasis>Payments</emphasis> are transfers of money out of the
    bank account, usually to an expense account. <emphasis>Deposits</emphasis>
    are transfers of money into the bank account, usually from an income
    account. You will need to set up income and expense accounts to track
    where that money comes from and where it goes. Remember that a balanced
    transaction requires a transfer of an equal sum of money from at least one
    account to at least one other account. So if you deposit money in your
    checking account, you must also enter the account that money comes from.
    If you pay a bill from your checking account, you must also enter the
    account where that money goes.</para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="cbook-deposits1">
    <title>Entering Deposits</title>
    <para>Most deposit transactions are entered as a transfer from an income
    account to a bank account. Income may come from many sources, and it&rsquo;s a
    good idea to set up a separate income type account for each different
    source. For example, your income may come mainly from your paychecks, but
    you may also receive interest on your savings. In this case, you should
    have one income account for salary and another income account for interest
    income.</para>
    <tip>
      <para>Be sure to check the Tax-Related box and assign an appropriate tax
      category in the Income Tax Information Dialog (<menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Tax
      Report Options</guimenuitem></menuchoice>)
      when you set up taxable income accounts. Some types of income,
      such as gift income, may not be considered taxable, so check the
      appropriate tax rules to determine what is taxable. For ways to track
      capital gains income, refer to <xref linkend="chapter_capgain"/>.</para>
    </tip>
    <para>Before you start entering paycheck deposits, decide how much detail
    you want to track. The basic level of detail is to enter your net pay,
    just like you would in your paper register. This is easiest, but you can
    get even more information out of &app; if you enter your gross pay with
    deductions. It takes a bit more effort to enter the deductions, but
    entering your tax withholding information throughout the year allows you
    to run useful tax status reports in &app; at any time. These reports can
    help you determine whether you are withholding enough tax, and they can
    help you estimate your tax bill ahead of time. If you are unsure about the
    level of detail, start by entering net pay. You can always go back and
    edit your transactions later if you decide you want more detail.</para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="cbook-withdrawals1">
    <title>Entering Withdrawals</title>
    <para>When you withdraw money from your bank account, for whatever reason,
    you are transferring money from your bank account to some other location.
    In &app;, this other location is tracked as an account. The more
    detailed accounts you create and use for your spending, the more
    information you will get about where your money goes.</para>
    <para>Withdrawals take many forms. ATM withdrawals are one of the most
    common transactions. Writing checks is one way to withdraw money to pay
    bills, to buy purchases, or to give to charity. Depending on your bank,
    you might also have service charges, where the bank withdraws the money
    from your account. Transfers of money out to another account are also
    withdrawals. We will take a look at each of these types of withdrawals and
    how to record them in &app;.</para>
    <sect2 id="cbook-atm2">
      <title>ATM/Cash Withdrawals</title>
      <para>Cash withdrawals are handled as a transfer from a bank account to
      a cash account. &app; provides special <emphasis>Cash</emphasis> type
      accounts for tracking your cash purchases, so you should set up a cash
      account to record your ATM and other cash withdrawals.</para>
      <para>Cash accounts can be used for different levels of detail. On a
      basic level of detail, you simply transfer money to it from your
      checking account. That tells you how much money you took out of checking
      on a given day, but it doesn&rsquo;t tell you where that cash was spent. With
      a little more effort, you can use the cash account to record your cash
      purchases as well, so that you can see where that cash went. You record
      these purchases as a transfer from the cash account to expense
      accounts.</para>
      <para>Some people record every cash purchase, but this takes a lot of
      work. An easier way is to record the purchases for which you have
      receipts, but then adjust the balance of the account to match what is in
      your wallet.</para>
      <para>It&rsquo;s a good idea to at least set up a cash account for your
      withdrawals. Then if you decide to track where your cash goes, you can
      enter transactions for the money you spend. You determine what level of
      detail you want to use.</para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="cbook-reconacct1">
    <title>Reconciling Your Accounts</title>
    <para>&app; makes reconciliation of your bank account with your monthly
    bank statement much easier. <xref linkend="txns-reconcile1"/>
    gives instructions on how to
    reconcile your transactions with the monthly bank statement. This is the
    main reconciliation task that should be done every month.</para>
    <para>But what about all those other accounts you created? Should those be
    reconciled too? If you receive a statement for the account, then you
    should consider reconciling that account. Examples include the checking
    account statement, the savings account statement, and the credit card
    statement. Credit card statements and credit card transactions are covered
    in the <xref linkend="chapter_cc"/>, so if you are interested in
    tracking your credit cards in &app;, take a look at the instructions
    provided there.</para>
    <para>Income and expense accounts are usually not reconciled, because
    there is no statement to check them against. You also don&rsquo;t need to
    reconcile cash accounts, for the same reason. With a cash account, though,
    you might want to adjust the balance every once in a while, so that your
    actual cash on hand matches the balance in your cash account. Adjusting
    balances is covered in the next section.</para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="cbook-together1">
    <title>Putting It All Together</title>
    <para>In <xref linkend="chapter_txns"/>, you entered some transactions
    in your checking account. In this chapter, we will add more transactions and
    then reconcile them.</para>
    <sect2 id="cbook-puttoget-open2">
      <title>Opening Balances</title>
      <para>So, let&rsquo;s get started by opening the gcashdata file you saved in the
      last chapter (<filename>gcashdata_4</filename>). Your chart of accounts
      should look like this:</para>

          <para>Now open the <emphasis>Checking</emphasis> account from the main window. In the last
          chapter, you entered some paycheck transactions as deposits into
          Checking. Now we will enter another kind of deposit - a transfer of
          money from Savings into Checking. On a blank line, enter a transaction
          to transfer $500 from <emphasis>Savings</emphasis> to <emphasis>Checking</emphasis> (In this case, the last
          transaction date was March 28, but this transfer transaction took
          place on the March 24). Your Transfer account will be <emphasis>Savings</emphasis>, since
          you are in the <emphasis>Checking</emphasis> account. Your <emphasis>Checking</emphasis> account should now look
          like this:</para>

          <para>Now let&rsquo;s write some checks on this account. First, write a
          check to HomeTown Grocery for $75 (5th of March). Your transfer account
          is <emphasis>Groceries</emphasis>, since all of this money is going to buy groceries. Next,
          write a check to ABC Hardware for $100 (6 of March), and split this
          amount between two expenses: <emphasis>Household</emphasis> $50 and <emphasis>Tools</emphasis> $50. You will
          need to create an <emphasis>Expense</emphasis> type account for each of these, then enter
          splits for them. Your checking account should now look like
