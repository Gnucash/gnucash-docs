  <title>Multiple Currencies</title>

  <para>This chapter will show you how to setup your <application>&app;</application> accounts to use
  multiple currencies.</para>

  <sect1 id="currency_concepts1">
    <title>Basic Concepts</title>

    <para><application>&app;</application> supports over a hundred currencies, from the Andorran Franc
    to the Zimbabwe Dollar. For example, you can have a bank account setup in Euros, and
    another using Hong Kong Dollars.</para>

    <para>Some of the issues which arise when using multiple currencies are, how
    do you transfer funds between accounts with different currencies? How do
    you calculate the overall value when you have mixed currency accounts? How
    do reports deal with mixed currencies?</para>
    
    <note>
      <para>An alternative way to manage multiple currency accounts from the one
      presented in the next sections, is to use the <guilabel>trading</guilabel> accounts 
      capabilities of <application>&app;</application>. This feature, which has been 
      introduced with <application>&app;</application> version 2.3.14, can be enabled by 
      going to the <guilabel>Accounts</guilabel> tab under <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>
      Properties</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.</para>
      <para>For a complete guide on <guilabel>trading</guilabel> accounts
      you can take a look <ulink type="http" url="http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/accounting/tutorial.html">
      at this tutorial by Peter Selinger</ulink>.</para>
    </note>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="currency_acct1">
    <title>Account Setup</title>

    <para>Your default account currency is set in the <guilabel>Account</guilabel> tab 
    under <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
    (<menuchoice><guimenu>&app;</guimenu><guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem></menuchoice> on Mac OS X).
    You should set this parameter correctly, as it will save you much time when building
    your account structure.</para>

    <para>Similarly, <application>&app;</application> offers an option to
    set your preferred currency for displaying reports (like the balance
    sheet and income statement). The option is called <guilabel>Default
    Report Currency</guilabel>, and is in the <guilabel>Reports</guilabel>
    tab of the <guilabel>&app; Preferences</guilabel> screen.
    You&rsquo;ll want to set both options when you start using
    <application>&app;</application> because if (for example) your accounts
    are all in Canadian Dollars but the generated reports are all in US
    Dollars, the reports will just say that there is <quote>no
    data/transactions (or only zeroes) for the selected time
    period</quote>.</para>

    <para>When you create a new account, you have the option to define the
    commodity. For currency accounts, you can specify any one of the hundreds
    of currencies supported by <application>&app;</application> by simply selecting it from the
    currency commodity list. You will notice that the default currency is
    always whatever you have defined in the preferences. So, if you mostly
    work with Euros, but have the occasional Ethiopian Birr account, be sure
    to set your preferences to Euro.</para>

    <para>As an example, let&rsquo;s set up a typical bank account scenario where
    you mostly work in US Dollars, but do also have a European bank account
    using the Euro currency, as well as one bank account in Hong Kong using
    Hong Kong Dollars. So, setup 3 bank accounts, one using the Euro currency,
    one in US Dollars, and another in Hong Kong Dollars. One possible account
    structure for this would be:</para>

    <literallayout>
-Assets                          (USD)
   -Current Assets           (USD)
      -US Bank                 (USD)
      -European Bank       (EUR)
      -HK Bank             (HKD)
-Equity                          (USD)
   -Opening Balances
      -USD            (USD)
      -EUR            (EUR)   
      -EUR            (HKD)

Note: the currency of each account is shown in parenthesis.
 </literallayout>

    <para>Since in this example you mostly work in USD, all of the parent
    accounts are set to USD. Of course, if you mostly work in Euros, you could
    change the currency of these parent accounts to EUR. The totals shown in
    the account tree window will always be converted to the currency of each
    particular account. Notice, we also set up 3 Starting Balances equity
    accounts, used to initially populate the 3 banks.</para>

    <note>
      <para>You could also setup just a single Starting Balance account and
      use a currency transfer to populate the <quote>different currency</quote> accounts.
      However, this is more advanced option, which is explained in a later
      section (<xref linkend="currency_purchase2" />.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Below you see the result of this example, in which you start with
    USD 10,000, EUR 10,000 as well as HKD 10,000 in the three bank accounts.
    Notice that the total of the parent accounts only show the value of the
    currency of sub-accounts with matching currencies. In the future you can
    setup the exchange rates between the currencies, and the parent accounts
    will calculate the converted value of all sub-accounts. See the later
    section (<xref linkend="currency_howto1" />) on how to do this.</para>

    <sect2 id="currency_acct_user2">
      <title>User-Defined Currencies</title>

      <para>Usually when we talk about currencies, we mean
      government-backed currencies (or more precisely, currencies defined
      in the international standard called <ulink
      url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217">ISO 4217</ulink>).
      <application>&app;</application> does not allow you to create your
      own currencies. If you want to track non-<acronym>ISO</acronym>
      currencies, you can use either of two workarounds, depending on which
      fits your needs better.</para>

      <para>Let&rsquo;s say for example that you want to track RewardMiles,
      which count how many loyalty points you&rsquo;ve earned by buying
      from a certain group of businesses. The account which tracks your
      RewardMiles will be <emphasis>Assets:Other:LoyaltyGroupRewardMiles</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>The first method is to define a new security, of type <guilabel>FUND</guilabel>,
      called RewardMiles. This is pretty straightforward&ndash;when you
      create the new <emphasis>LoyaltyGroupRewardMiles</emphasis> account, just set the account
      type to <guilabel>Stock</guilabel> or <guilabel>Mutual
      Fund</guilabel>, click the <guibutton>Select...</guibutton> button
      next to the <guilabel>Security/currency:</guilabel> box, and click
      <guibutton>New</guibutton> to define a new security of type
      <guilabel>FUND</guilabel>.</para>

      <para>This is not really what the stock and mutual fund account types
      are meant for, but <application>&app;</application> usually lets you
      decide how you want to use it, instead of dictating. The downside is
      that you&rsquo;ll have to enter a <quote>price</quote> for every
      transaction involving RewardMiles, because
      <application>&app;</application> needs the prices to figure out the
      monetary value of RewardMiles and treat them as one of your
      assets.</para>

      <para>The second method is to use one of the <quote>dummy</quote>
      currencies to track the RewardMiles. The dummy currencies are
      <quote>XTS (Code for testing purposes)</quote> and <quote>XXX (No
      currency)</quote>. If you use one of these for your
      LoyaltyGroupRewardMiles account, you can enter transactions into the
      account without having to enter share prices for every transaction.
      And, you can keep using the same two dummy currencies to track all
      sorts of amounts&ndash;vacation dollars earned and used so far this
      year, vacation hours earned and used, health insurance benefits
      allowance used and remaining, and so on. You can well imagine that
      <application>&app;</application> can be used as a hub for all sorts
      of personal metrics, in addition to finances.</para>

      <para>The drawback with this second method is that you cannot define exchange rates for
      the dummy currencies to convert them to <acronym>ISO</acronym>
      currencies. If you want to do that, you really should use the first
      method.</para>

      <para>Your long-time Japanese friend offers you a Japanese house loan if

      decide to accept his offer. </para>

      <note>
        <para>Again, this should not be taken as financial advice. Please
        consult with a registered financial advisor before undertaking
        investing (or speculating) in overseas markets, or local markets for
        that matter.</para>

        <para>A word of warning might be of interest here, taking a loan
        overseas for a very low interest rate might seem like a very good
        deal. Do keep in mind though that the exchange rate might change and
        can change drastically. If you take a loan in your local currency, you
        only have to worry about the interest rate. If you take a loan overseas,
        you then have to worry about the interest rate and the exchange rate.
