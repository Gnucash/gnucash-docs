    </para>

    <para>
      As can be seen there are some fields that are absent and some that
      are not required for import. The first line is not required and the last
      line is superfluous as <application>&app;</application> will total the order for us. All that is
      required is to take what we want and produce an output file with the
      correct format to import into <application>&app;</application>. In this case we join the part
      number and description fields and these become description in <application>&app;</application>
      invoice/bill. We need the qty and part price fields. Contrary to the
      header line <acronym>VAT</acronym> is not included by line and is always zero, the <acronym>VAT</acronym> is
      calculated on the last line as <acronym>VAT</acronym> on the order total.
      <note>
        <para>This will cause problems later.</para>
      </note>
      In this example I have assigned the
      <emphasis>Expenses:Materials General</emphasis> account to be the target account. This can be
      changed after import in the usual way, along with any other data. If there
      is no such account as <emphasis>Expenses:Materials General</emphasis> then that field will be
      left blank on import and will have to be set manually. Lines beginning
      with a <quote>#</quote> are regarded as comment lines and ignored.
    </para>

    <para>The script is called with the following command:</para>
      <para> <command>python importer.py <replaceable>file_to_import</replaceable>,
      <replaceable>invoice_id</replaceable> &gt; <replaceable>file_to_save_as.csv</replaceable></command>
      </para>
    <para>This short script can easily be
      changed to suit any downloaded format. The only restriction is that the
      final number of field is fixed, at least at the moment. The importer will
      ignore lines with the wrong number of fields. (This may be fixed in future
      version). Vendor ID is simply the ID assigned to the specific vendor, or
      client. The row[N] items refer to the position in the line where the
      correct data lies. Note that the first field is row[0] NOT row[1].
    </para>

    <para>Once you have converted the file navigate to <menuchoice><guimenu>Business</guimenu>
      <guimenuitem>Invoice &amp; Bill Import</guimenuitem></menuchoice> to open a new import window. 
      Select the file you have just created, select <guilabel>Bill</guilabel> 
      or <guilabel>Invoice</guilabel> and <guilabel>Comma separated</guilabel> format. At this
      point the data should show up in the preview window. Check that the field
      data are in the correct columns before selecting <guibutton>OK</guibutton>. Once imported the
      invoice can be opened for editing and posting in the usual way.
    </para>

    <para>A note on <acronym>VAT</acronym>, or any purchase tax. As previously mentioned <emphasis>Rapid
      Electronics</emphasis> calculate the <acronym>VAT</acronym> on the bill total not line by line. <application>&app;</application>
      calculated the <acronym>VAT</acronym> per line then totals the <acronym>VAT</acronym>. This can lead to
      inaccuracies in the <acronym>VAT</acronym> of the region of a few pennies and is enough to
      cause problems when reconciling the purchase with your bank or credit card
      account used to make the purchase. As to how you overcome that, for the
      moment, is a problem for you to use whatever method suits your conscience
      or accountant best. Personally I add the <acronym>VAT</acronym> as a separate line along with
      delivery charges manually. So some work is left to the user but the tedium
      of entering each item eliminated.
    </para>

    <para>Future: Currently the import format is quite strict and many users
      may have problems with the conversion process. Adding a template for every
      possible vendor <acronym>CSV</acronym> format would be mammoth and likely impossible task
      notwithstanding the fact the vendors are likely to change the format
      without informing the <application>&app;</application> team. Future import enhancements will be
      based on user feedback and hopefully the process can be made simpler or
      more flexible. Note that often <quote>simple</quote> is incompatible with
      <quote>flexible</quote>.
    </para>

    <para>If <application>Python</application> (other languages are avaialble) is not your thing then
      post a request to <ulink url="https://lists.gnucash.org/mailman/listinfo/gnucash-user"><citetitle>&app; user list</citetitle></ulink>, 
      with an example of your downloaded <acronym>CSV</acronym>, and someone may write you a <application>Python</application> script to do the
      translation.

    <para>
    Fields can be separated with commas or semicolons and each field can be in quotes.  These options are selectable in the import dialog. Vendors don&rsquo;t have shipping information so even though the fields have to exist, leave them empty.
    The id field is optional and if it is empty a new id will be chosen. If the id field has a value this will UPDATE any vendor/customer with the same id.  This may not be what you want.  Note that in your input file the data must be a single line for each customer/vendor.

    <para>
      The importer does not currently import billing information for customers or vendors, these will have to be edited individually after importing.
