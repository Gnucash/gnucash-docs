  <title>Accounts Payable</title>

  <para>Accounts Payable (or A/P) refers to the accounting of products or services which a company has
    bought and needs to pay for.
  </para>

  <sect1 id="bus-ap-components1">
    <title>System Components</title>

    <para>&app; has an integrated accounts payable system. The transactions generated by the A/P system are
      placed within the Accounts Payable account, as a record of what occurs. Generally you do not
      directly work with this account but use the four integrated &app; A/P application components.
      The A/P components are available from the
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Business</guimenu><guisubmenu>Vendor</guisubmenu>
      </menuchoice>
      sub-menu. These A/P components are:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><guilabel>Vendors</guilabel> are people or companies from which you buy products or services on
          credit.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><guilabel>Bills</guilabel> represent the physical bills vendors send to request payment from you. A
          bill contains an itemized list of things you purchased.
        </para>

        <para>In addition, GnuCash also has support for <guilabel>Credit Notes</guilabel> which represent the
          inverse of Bills. A credit note is usually received from a vendor to correct items that
          were erroneously billed or returned.
        </para>

        <para>Both document types will be set up using the same menu items.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><guilabel>Jobs</guilabel> (optional) is where you register Vendor Jobs. Jobs are mechanism by which
          you can group multiple bills from a particular vendor.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><guilabel>Process Payments</guilabel> is where you register payments to a vendor to whom you owe
          money.

    <title>Vendors</title>

    <para>A vendor is a company or person from whom you purchase goods or services. Vendors must be registered
      within the A/P system.

      <title>Find and Edit</title>

      <para>To search for an existing vendor, use the
        <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>Business</guimenu><guisubmenu>Vendor</guisubmenu><guimenuitem> Find
          Vendor</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>
        window. You select a vendor to <guibutton>View/Edit</guibutton> from the results of the
        search. This window is also used to look up a vendor when entering bills and processing
        payments.
      </para>

      <para>If many vendors match the search criteria you provide, the search can be refined by running an
        additional search within the current results. The current result set is searched when the
        <guilabel>Refine Current Search</guilabel> radio button is selected. In fact, &app; selects
        this option for you after you run the initial search.
      </para>

      <para>If the vendor you are searching for does not match the supplied search criteria, change the search
        criteria, click the <guilabel>New Search</guilabel> radio button and then the
        <guibutton>Find</guibutton> button. The relevant step is the <guilabel>New Search</guilabel>
        selection. If the vendor is not in the result of the original search, and you only search
        within this set, the vendor cannot be found, regardless of new search criteria.
      </para>

      <note>
        <para>To return a list of all registered active vendors, set the search criterion to <guilabel>matches
          regex</guilabel>, and place a single dot <quote>.</quote> in the text field area. Make
          sure <guilabel>Search only active data</guilabel> is checked, then click
          <guibutton>Find</guibutton>. The regular expression <quote>.</quote> means to match
          anything.

  <sect1 id="bus-ap-bills1">
    <title>Bills</title>

    <para>A bill is a request for payment you receive from a vendor. &app; can track bills.
    </para>

    <para>A credit note is the document you receive from a vendor to correct products or services rendered
      that you were incorrectly charged for on a bill. &app; can generate and track credit notes via
      the same menu entries as bills.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>This section applies to both bills and credit notes. In order to avoid repeating everything twice
        and to keep the text easier to read it will refer only to bills. You can apply it equally to
        credit notes. Only where the behaviour of credit notes differs from bills this will be
        explicitly mentioned.

      <title>New</title>

      <para>When you receive a bill from a vendor and want to enter it into &app;, you must create a new bill.
