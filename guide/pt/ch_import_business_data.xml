    <para>This functionality is only available by default for versions greater than 2.6
    </para>

    <para>For 2.4.13 the Customers and Vendors importer is an optional module and needs to enabled by editing
      the file <filename>$HOME/.gnucash/config.user</filename>, adding the line:
    </para>

    <para><code>(gnc:module-load "gnucash/plugins/bi_import" 0)</code>

    <para>On &lin; systems this file is found at <filename>$HOME/.gnucash/config.user</filename> and on
      &mac; it is <filename>~/Library/Application Support/Gnucash/config.user</filename>. If the file
      doesn&rsquo;t already exist you will have to create it. After restarting &app;, the item will
      appear at the bottom of the business menu.
    </para>

    <para>In order for the importer to work the data must be in a fixed field length, comma separated line

    </para>

    <para>As can be seen there are some fields that are absent and some that are not required for import. The
      first line is not required and the last line is superfluous as &app; will total the order for
      us. All that is required is to take what we want and produce an output file with the correct
      format to import into &app;. In this case we join the part number and description fields and
      these become description in &app; invoice/bill. We need the qty and part price fields.
      Contrary to the header line <acronym>VAT</acronym> is not included by line and is always zero,
      the <acronym>VAT</acronym> is calculated on the last line as <acronym>VAT</acronym> on the
      order total.
      <note>
        <para>This will cause problems later.
        </para>
      </note>
      In this example I have assigned the <emphasis>Expenses:Materials General</emphasis> account to
      be the target account. This can be changed after import in the usual way, along with any other
      data. If there is no such account as <emphasis>Expenses:Materials General</emphasis> then that
      field will be left blank on import and will have to be set manually. Lines beginning with a
      <quote>#</quote> are regarded as comment lines and ignored.
    </para>

    <para>The script is called with the following command:
    </para>

    <para><command>python importer.py <replaceable>file_to_import</replaceable>,
      <replaceable>invoice_id</replaceable> &gt;
      <replaceable>file_to_save_as.csv</replaceable></command>
    </para>

    <para>This short script can easily be changed to suit any downloaded format. The only restriction is that
      the final number of field is fixed, at least at the moment. The importer will ignore lines
      with the wrong number of fields. (This may be fixed in future version). Vendor ID is simply
      the ID assigned to the specific vendor, or client. The row[N] items refer to the position in
      the line where the correct data lies. Note that the first field is row[0] NOT row[1].
    </para>

    <para>Once you have converted the file navigate to
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Business</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Invoice &amp; Bill Import</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
      to open a new import window. Select the file you have just created, select
      <guilabel>Bill</guilabel> or <guilabel>Invoice</guilabel> and <guilabel>Comma
      separated</guilabel> format. At this point the data should show up in the preview window.
      Check that the field data are in the correct columns before selecting
      <guibutton>OK</guibutton>. Once imported the invoice can be opened for editing and posting in
      the usual way.
    </para>

    <para>A note on <acronym>VAT</acronym>, or any purchase tax. As previously mentioned <emphasis>Rapid
      Electronics</emphasis> calculate the <acronym>VAT</acronym> on the bill total not line by
      line. &app; calculated the <acronym>VAT</acronym> per line then totals the
      <acronym>VAT</acronym>. This can lead to inaccuracies in the <acronym>VAT</acronym> of the
      region of a few pennies and is enough to cause problems when reconciling the purchase with
      your bank or credit card account used to make the purchase. As to how you overcome that, for
      the moment, is a problem for you to use whatever method suits your conscience or accountant
      best. Personally I add the <acronym>VAT</acronym> as a separate line along with delivery
      charges manually. So some work is left to the user but the tedium of entering each item
      eliminated.
    </para>

    <para>Future: Currently the import format is quite strict and many users may have problems with the
      conversion process. Adding a template for every possible vendor <acronym>CSV</acronym> format
      would be mammoth and likely impossible task notwithstanding the fact the vendors are likely to
      change the format without informing the &app; team. Future import enhancements will be based
      on user feedback and hopefully the process can be made simpler or more flexible. Note that
      often <quote>simple</quote> is incompatible with <quote>flexible</quote>.

      <para>If <application>Python</application> (other languages are avaialble) is not your thing then post a

        list</citetitle></ulink>, with an example of your downloaded <acronym>CSV</acronym>, and
        someone may write you a <application>Python</application> script to do the translation.

    <para>Fields can be separated with commas or semicolons and each field can be in quotes. These options are
      selectable in the import dialog. Vendors don&rsquo;t have shipping information so even though
      the fields have to exist, leave them empty. The id field is optional and if it is empty a new
      id will be chosen. If the id field has a value this will UPDATE any vendor/customer with the
      same id. This may not be what you want. Note that in your input file the data must be a single
      line for each customer/vendor.

    <para>The importer does not currently import billing information for customers or vendors, these will have
