      <title>Setting Up, Editing &amp; Working with Accounts</title>

      <para>This section describes the process of setting up, editing and working with <application>&app;</application> Accounts.
        In <application>&app;</application> an Account is used as the basic tool to organize the recording of where money comes
        from and goes to. <application>&app;</application> also extends the concept of real world accounts such as a bank
        account or loan account to grouping income and expense accounts. This allows you to
        quickly see where you spent your money and what your major income and expenses are.
        <application>&app;</application> sets Account Types (as described in the next section) to help in organizing
        and grouping accounts. Account Types can be used to create a Chart of Accounts.

        <title>Creating a Chart of Accounts</title>

        <para>The Chart of Accounts is like a table of contents for your finances. The best
        way to conceptualize a chart of accounts is as a tree. The main branches represent
        entire categories or groups, while the leaves of the tree denote individual bank
        accounts or expense categories. When a summary report is requested, typically only
        the main branches are shown in the report, rather than the individual accounts. For
        example, a chart of accounts might look like the following:</para>

         &chartacctseg;

        <note id="accts-code">
        <title>Accounts codes</title>
          <para>Note that accounts not only have names; they may have codes, to order the accounts.
          When a report is generated, the sort order is determined by the numbering. It&rsquo;s
          customary to have the leaf accounts end in non-zero digits, while parent nodes have
          increasing numbers of zeros.</para>
        </note>

        <warning>
          <para><application>&app;</application> does not prevent duplicate numbering, although we would encourage you
          to avoid this. Account codes are treated as numbers in base-36, thus, if you run out
          of numbers, you can use the letters, a through z.</para>

             <para>To determine if the Perl module <application>Finance::Quote</application> is already installed on
              your system, type <quote>perldoc Finance::Quote</quote> in a terminal window

              simply use your preferred package manager (yum, apt, rpm, synaptics, yast,...)
              to install the module. The name of the package may vary from one distribution to

          <para>The command <userinput>gnucash --add-price-quotes &lt;gnucash-file-name&gt;</userinput>
          can be used to fetch the current prices of your stocks.  The file specified
          <quote>&lt;gnucash-file-name&gt;</quote> will depend on the name and location of your

          in the list of recently opened file; the first item, numbered 1, is the name of the currently

          <para>This can be automated in Mac OSX by creating a crontab entry. For example, to update your file every Friday

        <title>Deleting an Account</title>
        <para></para>
        <para>Deleting an Account means removing all transaction information and information about this
         account from the file. This cannot be undone. You will be prompted to verify that you wish to
         remove the account. If the account still contains transaction information you will be warned that this
         account contains transactions.</para>

        <para>A side effect of removing an account that contains transactions is that you will
         end up with unbalanced accounts. This will be indicated in the account by a gray
         check-box next to the debit and credit amounts. You can automatically repair these
         unbalanced accounts by using the <menuchoice><guimenu>Actions</guimenu><guimenuitem>Check &amp; 
         Repair</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu. This will automatically assign the unbalanced amounts 
         to a new account named <emphasis role="bold">Imbalance.

        <title>Reconciling an Account to a Statement</title>

        <para>Reconciliation of Accounts in <application>&app;</application> with statements from a bank or other
         institution is a way of double checking the accuracy of your (and your banks) transactions and the balance
         of your accounts. It also is useful to track uncleared checks and other outstanding transactions.</para>

      <para>The reconciling process in <application>&app;</application> involves two dialogs: the 
      <xref linkend="tool-reconcile" /> dialog followed by the <xref linkend="rec-win" /> window. They provide access 
      to various <application>&app;</application> functions to make it easy to enter and update 
      account information during the reconciliation.</para>

      <tip>
        <para>The Reconcile window is accessed from the account tree window or the account register window by
        going to <menuchoice><guimenu>Actions</guimenu><guimenuitem>Reconcile...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> 
        or using the menu shortcut <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>A</keycap></keycombo>, <keycap>R</keycap>.</para>
      </tip>

        <para>The <emphasis>Summary Bar</emphasis> at the bottom of the Account Register Window indicates the amounts
         of <guilabel>Present</guilabel> (Balance), <guilabel>Future</guilabel> (Balance), <guilabel>Cleared</guilabel>
         (Transactions), <guilabel>Reconciled</guilabel> (Transactions) and
         <guilabel>Projected Minimum</guilabel>. On-line account information can be used to
         mark which transactions the bank has processed by changing the <guilabel>R</guilabel> (reconciliation status)
         column in the register from <guilabel>n</guilabel> (new) to <guilabel>c</guilabel> (cleared). The bank statement is then used
         with the <guilabel>Reconcile</guilabel> window to reconcile the account which changes the <guilabel>R</guilabel> field to
         <guilabel>y</guilabel> (reconciled).</para>

      <title>Reconciling Information</title>

        from the statement. The <guilabel>Include Sub-accounts</guilabel> check-box is used if one or more subaccounts are used to track
        the account you are reconciling. The <guibutton>Enter Interest Payment</guibutton> button is used to add a transfer to the
        accounts for an interest payment. If selected a dialog will be displayed to add the 
        <xref linkend="tool-ent-int" /> to the account.</para>
        <note>
