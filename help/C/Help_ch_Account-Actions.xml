      <title>Setting Up, Editing &amp; Working with Accounts</title>

      <para>This section describes the process of setting up, editing and working with <application>&app;</application> Accounts.
        In <application>&app;</application> an Account is used as the basic tool to organize the recording of where money comes
        from and goes to. <application>&app;</application> also extends the concept of real world accounts such as a bank
        account or loan account to grouping income and expense accounts. This allows you to
        quickly see where you spent your money and what your major income and expenses are.
        <application>&app;</application> sets Account Types (as described in the next section) to help in organizing
        and grouping accounts. Account Types can be used to create a Chart of Accounts.
      </para>

      <sect1 id="acct-types">

        <title>Creating a Chart of Accounts</title>

        <para>The Chart of Accounts is like a table of contents for your finances. The best
        way to conceptualize a chart of accounts is as a tree. The main branches represent
        entire categories or groups, while the leaves of the tree denote individual bank
        accounts or expense categories. When a summary report is requested, typically only
        the main branches are shown in the report, rather than the individual accounts. For
        example, a chart of accounts might look like the following:</para>

         &chartacctseg;

        <note id="accts-code">
        <title>Accounts codes</title>
          <para>Note that accounts not only have names; they may have codes, to order the accounts.
          When a report is generated, the sort order is determined by the numbering. It&rsquo;s
          customary to have the leaf accounts end in non-zero digits, while parent nodes have
          increasing numbers of zeros.</para>
        </note>

        <warning>
          <para><application>&app;</application> does not prevent duplicate numbering, although we would encourage you
          to avoid this. Account codes are treated as numbers in base-36, thus, if you run out
          of numbers, you can use the letters, a through z.</para>

              updating should thus be to ensure <application>Finance::Quote</application> is properly installed.</para>

             <para>To determine if the Perl module <application>Finance::Quote</application> is already installed on
              your system, type <quote>perldoc Finance::Quote</quote> in a terminal window

              simply use your preferred package manager (yum, apt, rpm, synaptics, yast,...)
              to install the module. The name of the package may vary from one distribution to

        <title>Deleting an Account</title>
        <para></para>
        <para>Deleting an Account means removing all transaction information and information about this
         account from the file. This cannot be undone. You will be prompted to verify that you wish to
         remove the account. If the account still contains transaction information you will be warned that this
         account contains transactions.</para>

        <para>A side effect of removing an account that contains transactions is that you will
         end up with unbalanced accounts. This will be indicated in the account by a gray
         check-box next to the debit and credit amounts. You can repair automatically these
         unbalanced accounts by using the <menuchoice><guimenu>Actions</guimenu><guimenuitem>Check &amp; 
         Repair</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu. This will automatically assign the unbalanced amounts 
         to a new account named <emphasis role="bold">Imbalance.

        <title>Reconciling an Account to a Statement</title>
        <para>Reconciliation of Accounts in <application>&app;</application> with statements from a bank or other
         institution is a way of double checking the accuracy of your (and your banks) transactions and the balance
         of your accounts. It also is useful to track uncleared checks and other outstanding transactions. </para>

        <para>The <emphasis>Summary Bar</emphasis> at the bottom of the Account Register Window indicates the amounts
         of Present (Balance), Future (Balance), Cleared (Transactions), Reconciled (Transactions) and
         Projected Minimum. On-line account information can be used to
         mark which transactions the bank has processed by changing the R (reconciliation status)
         column in the register from n (new) to c (cleared). The bank statement is then used
         with the Reconcile Window to reconcile the account which changes the R field to y
         (reconciled).</para>

        <para>The Reconciling Windows are accessed in the Account Tree Window or the Account Register Window by
         going to <menuchoice><guimenu>Actions</guimenu><guimenuitem>Reconcile...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>

<!--        <title>Reconciling Windows</title>

        <para>The Reconciling Windows are used to reconcile bank statements to
        <application>&app;</application> accounts. They provide access to various <application>&app;</application> functions to
        make it easy to enter and update account information during the
        reconciliation.</para>

          <title>Reconciling Information Window</title>

          <para>The Reconcile Information dialog is used to indicate the closing statement date
           and the starting (fixed from last reconciliation) and ending balance from the statement. The <guilabel>Include
           Sub-accounts</guilabel> check-box is used if two or more accounts are used to track a single
           bank account. The <guilabel>Enter Interest Payment</guilabel> button is used to add a transfer to the
           accounts for an interest payment. If selected a dialog will be displayed to add the interest
           payment to the account.</para>

          <para>There are three panes in the Interest Payment dialog. At the bottom is a
           button called <guibutton>No Auto Interest Payments for this Account</guibutton> which will cancel the
           dialog. The top pane contains the Payment Information.</para>

          <para>The next window contains a list of accounts for the <quote>Payment From</quote> account. If the
           payment is for a credit or loan account then usually this would be from an Expense
           account. If the payment is for a checking or savings account then usually this would
           be from an Income account. The Show Income/Expense check-box shows or hides the
           Income and Expense accounts.</para>
