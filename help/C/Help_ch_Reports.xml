  <title>Reports And Charts</title>

     <note><para>This section is a <quote>work in process</quote> all of the material has not been reviewed for V2.0.
      While it may not be strictly accurate, it is at least a "guide".</para></note>

   <para>Reports and Charts give <application>&app;</application> the ability to present an overview of financial
    data in various ways. This can range from a simple summary of account totals to an
    advanced portfolio view. This section will present an explanation of the main <application>&app;</application>
    reports and how to adjust them.</para>

   <para><application>&app;</application> has classified the main types of reports into four major classes. These
    are all available under the Reports menu.</para>

     <sect1 id="report-general">
      <title>General Reports</title>

       <para>The General Reports include the Account Summary Report, Custom Reports, the Tax Schedule Report and <acronym>TXF</acronym> Export, and the Transaction Report and also the reports in the Sample &amp; Custom menu.</para>

        <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
          <para>Account Summary:</para>
         </listitem>

         <listitem id="report-taxreport">
          <para>Tax Schedule Report and <acronym>TXF</acronym> Export: The tax schedule report lists all taxable income and deductible expense amounts used in the preparation of US Income Tax returns. The purpose of the report is to provide a complete audit trail for these amounts. The report is intended to be used by a tax payer to manually prepare his or her own tax return, or alternatively, to be provided to a tax preparer for that purpose. The report can also be used to generate an export of all tax related income and expenses to a <acronym>TXF</acronym> (Tax eXchange Format) file (this is in addition to exporting to the <acronym>HTML</acronym> format that all reports allow). The <acronym>TXF</acronym> file can be imported into tax filing programs such as TaxCut or TurboTax. The report should be run, inspected carefully for errors or omissions, and then corrections made to transactions, report settings, currency conversion rates or the account structure as needed. This process should be repeated as often as needed until all the amounts on the report are correct before a final version is used and saved along with the tax returns.</para>

          <para> For accounts specified in the report options (none = all) that are also flagged as <guilabel>Tax-related</guilabel>, all transactions for the time period selected (also in the report options) are included. The report sorts transactions by date within account providing subtotals by account within tax code within Form or Schedule line number. Support is also provided for multiple copies of and for sub-line items for selected Forms/Schedules. Optionally uses special date processing to include federal estimated tax payments after year end.</para>

          <para>All totals are in USD since this is the currency required for filing US Income Tax returns. Non-USD transaction amounts are converted to USD using the transaction conversion rate to USD, if available. If not, a conversion rate from the price database is used (either the date nearest the transaction date or nearest the report date as specified in the report options; if none is available, transaction amounts are converted to zero and the report provides a comment accordingly). A complete audit trail of conversions is provided.</para>

          <note><para>For this to work, the user has to segregate taxable and non taxable
           income to different accounts, as well as deductible and non deductible expenses.
           The Income Tax Information dialog is used for this. To access the Income Tax
           Information dialog go to <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Tax Report Options</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. The user
           also must set the <acronym>TXF</acronym> category of each tax related account. The Income Tax
           Information dialog is described in the <xref linkend="set-tax-options"></xref> section.</para></note>

    <title>Assets &amp; Liabilities</title>

     <para>The Assets &amp; Liabilities reports includes the Balance Sheet report,
      Investment reports and the Net Worth report.</para>

        <para>Asset Barchart:</para>

        <para>The Asset Barchart report displays bars that present the value of all assets in a
        <application>&app;</application> file over time.  By default, the report shows all accounts
        in <emphasis>Accounts Receivable</emphasis>, <emphasis>Current Assets</emphasis>,
        <emphasis>Fixed Assets</emphasis>, <emphasis>Investments</emphasis> and Special Accounts
        (if they exist) and it displays monthly bars for the current financial period. 
        This report provides a graphic view of the assets in the file over time.</para>

        <tip>
          <para>Like all the generic reports, the user can assign a title and save the report with 
          it's selected options for re-use later.</para>
        </tip>  
        
        <para>The display is in the form of either a stacked barchart or simple barchart with an 
        option to display a table of the values.</para>

        <para>This report calculates and displays a default of 8 bars or up to 24 separate asset
        accounts value at the end of the day on several dates through a specified time period.
        The report automatically selects the most significant accounts to display with all other
        selected accounts summed as <emphasis>Other</emphasis>.</para>

        <para>The report exploits the outline structure of the chart of accounts to allow the user
        to select top level accounts and sub-accounts down to a user-selectable depth.  Selected 
        sub-accounts below the selected depth are automatically <emphasis>summed up</emphasis> into
        the next level when it is also selected.  The default number of sub-account levels is 2,
        giving a summary view.  Increasing the number of sub-levels increases the detail available
        to display. It is possible to un-select a higher level account and leave sub-accounts 
        selected to force greater detail to appear in the report.</para>

        <para>By default the report includes all <emphasis>asset</emphasis> accounts and sub-accounts,
        as well as <emphasis>Imbalance</emphasis> and <emphasis>Orphan</emphasis> Special accounts
        in whatever currencies or commodities may be present. The report's base currency is the 
        default currency of the <application>&app;</application> file but if the file has data
        for multiple currencies, then it can be changed to another currency.</para>

        <para>Since each account may be individually selected, the report can be designed to focus 
        on a small subset of data such as current assets or investments.</para>

        <para>The overall interval of the report defaults to start at the start of the current 
        accounting period and to end at the end of the current accounting period. Numerous 
        other starting choices and ending choices are available.</para>

        <para>The first bar shows the selected values at the end of the day on the first date chosen.
        There are a number of choices for step size from <emphasis>day</emphasis> to 
        <emphasis>year</emphasis> with the default being <emphasis>month</emphasis>. Note that if any 
        step date would fall on the 29th, 30th or 31st in a month that does not have such a date
        the next interval will be 31 days later. For that step only the date will <emphasis>slip</emphasis>
        up to 3 days into the following month. This is true for releases at least through 2.4.13.
        Bug 639049 is open in Bugzilla to modify this behavior.</para>

        <para>Currently, there is no option to start the report on the last day of any period. 
        There is also no option to show <emphasis>beginning</emphasis> balances or <emphasis>end of 
        previous step</emphasis> balances. This makes it difficult to correlate this report to 
        business quarterly reports, for example.</para>

        <para>The Net Worth linechart report, Liability barchart report and Net Worth barchart 
        report are similar except for the graphic type and default account groups selected.</para>

       <para>Other features are customizable in a manner similar to other standard reports.</para>

        <para>Budget Report:</para>
        
		  <para>This report is used to compare budgeted and real amounts for selected accounts. It
allows you to review how well you follow the budget.</para>

		  <para>Report is generated as a table where each row represent an account and a sets of columns show
budgeted amount, real amount and the difference between them for each report period.</para>

		  <para>Real amount is a sum of transactions for a budget period, so if you have a budget with 12
periods and each period is a month, then real amount columns will contain monthly
transactions sums for budgeted year.</para>

		  <para>Report support selecting a range of periods instead all of them. Periods, that are out of
range, can be included in report as the consolidated columns around selected range. This
allows you to focus on particular periods, for example current one, and is especially
useful for budgets with many periods, so if you have 12 period budget you can make a 3
column report in format "(all periods before columns set) (current period columns set) (all periods
after columns set)" that is easily fits to screen and allows you to match values with account names.</para>

        <para>Start/end range selection options can be divided in two types: absolute and relative.</para>
		  <para>Absolute options are: first, last and manual. They always produce the same period for the
report, whenever you execute it's generation (of course, assuming that count of budget
periods are not changing).</para>
		  <para>Relative options are: previous, current and next. When using them, period selection
depends on date when you execute report. So for "current" option, we determine current
date during report generation and find period, this date is belong to. For "previous" and
"next" options it is the same but we shift found period back or forth. If relative
report options fall out of valid period range of a selected budget, then the closest valid 
period is selected for report generation: if report periods are in future, then we 
select first period, if it in the past we select last period.

        <para><application>&app;</application> is able to print reports and to export the reports to <acronym>HTML</acronym> (web) pages. The
         Print <application>&app;</application> Document dialog is accessed from the <guibutton>Print</guibutton> button on the <emphasis>Toolbar</emphasis> or
         go to <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Print</guimenuitem></menuchoice> in the menu. To Export a report to a web page (<acronym>HTML</acronym>) select
         the <guibutton>Export</guibutton> button on the <emphasis>Toolbar</emphasis> and type in a file name.</para>


        <para>The Print <application>&app;</application> Document dialog is used to select which Printer to send the
         print job to or to print to a File. It also contains a Preview button to view the
         document before printing. Press Print to send the job to the selected printer or
         <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> to dismiss the Print dialog.</para>


        <para>Printing from an open register prints the Account Report, which is also called
         the Register Report. This lists transactions in the account with a total. Other
         reports print as viewed in the Report screen.</para>

        <title>Creating Reports and Graphs</title>

             <note><para>This section may need updating !!!</para> </note>

        <para>It is possible to write reports if the current ones are not suitable. To do this
         you will need to know Scheme (a LISP-like programming language), and it is an
         excellent idea to have a copy of the <application>&app;</application> source code available. </para>

        <para>The reporting interface is documented in the source code file
         <filename>src/report/report-system/doc/report-html.txt</filename>. The file <filename>src/report/utility-reports/hello-world.scm</filename>
         in the <application>&app;</application> source distribution provides a good example of how reports are
         developed.</para>

        <para>It is also necessary to access data from the engine to get information for your
         report. This is performed by a set of Scheme wrapper functions that are documented in
         the file <filename>src/g-wrap/gnc.html</filename>. Examine some of the other reports in src/scm/report for
         an indication of how they are used.</para>

        <para>At present, reports are produced by calling a <acronym>HTML</acronym>-generation API, which outputs
         a dialect of <acronym>HTML</acronym> and rendering this with a <acronym>HTML</acronym> widget. This has limitations,
         particularly when trying to align objects precisely, as might be necessary for
         printing onto pre-printed invoices for example.</para>
