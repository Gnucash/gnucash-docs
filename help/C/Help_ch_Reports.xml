  <title>Reports And Charts</title>

     <note><para>This section is a <quote>work in process</quote> all of the material has not been reviewed for V2.0.
      While it may not be strictly accurate, it is at least a "guide".</para></note>

   <para>Reports and Charts give <application>&app;</application> the ability to present an overview of financial
    data in various ways. This can range from a simple summary of account totals to an
    advanced portfolio view. This section will present an explanation of the main <application>&app;</application>
    reports and how to adjust them.</para>

   <para><application>&app;</application> has classified the main types of reports into four major classes. These
    are all available under the Reports menu.</para>

     <sect1 id="report-general">
      <title>General Reports</title>

       <para>The General Reports include the Account Summary Report, Custom Reports, the Tax Schedule Report and <acronym>TXF</acronym> Export, and the Transaction Report and also the reports in the Sample &amp; Custom menu.</para>

        <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
          <para>Account Summary:</para>
         </listitem>

         <listitem id="report-taxreport">
          <para>Tax Schedule Report and <acronym>TXF</acronym> Export: The tax schedule report lists all taxable income and deductible expense amounts used in the preparation of US Income Tax returns. The purpose of the report is to provide a complete audit trail for these amounts. The report is intended to be used by a tax payer to manually prepare his or her own tax return, or alternatively, to be provided to a tax preparer for that purpose. The report can also be used to generate an export of all tax related income and expenses to a <acronym>TXF</acronym> (Tax eXchange Format) file (this is in addition to exporting to the <acronym>HTML</acronym> format that all reports allow). The <acronym>TXF</acronym> file can be imported into tax filing programs such as TaxCut or TurboTax. The report should be run, inspected carefully for errors or omissions, and then corrections made to transactions, report settings, currency conversion rates or the account structure as needed. This process should be repeated as often as needed until all the amounts on the report are correct before a final version is used and saved along with the tax returns.</para>

          <para> For accounts specified in the report options (none = all) that are also flagged as <guilabel>Tax-related</guilabel>, all transactions for the time period selected (also in the report options) are included. The report sorts transactions by date within account providing subtotals by account within tax code within Form or Schedule line number. Support is also provided for multiple copies of and for sub-line items for selected Forms/Schedules. Optionally uses special date processing to include federal estimated tax payments after year end.</para>

          <para>All totals are in USD since this is the currency required for filing US Income Tax returns. Non-USD transaction amounts are converted to USD using the transaction conversion rate to USD, if available. If not, a conversion rate from the price database is used (either the date nearest the transaction date or nearest the report date as specified in the report options; if none is available, transaction amounts are converted to zero and the report provides a comment accordingly). A complete audit trail of conversions is provided.</para>

          <note><para>For this to work, the user has to segregate taxable and non taxable
           income to different accounts, as well as deductible and non deductible expenses.
           The Income Tax Information dialog is used for this. To access the Income Tax
           Information dialog go to <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Tax Report Options</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. The user
           also must set the <acronym>TXF</acronym> category of each tax related account. The Income Tax
           Information dialog is described in the <xref linkend="set-tax-options"></xref> section.</para></note>

              <note>
                <para>To include income from dividends which are not reinvested (if there is no split to the stock account in the income transaction, the report has no way of associating the income with a particular stock) :
                </para>
		<para>Ensure there is a dummy transaction split to the stock         account with quantity 0, price 1 and value 0 in the dividend transaction. Enter the dummy stock split with no values in the dividend account and it will create the transaction with price 1 even though you cannot see the Price column in that register.
		</para>
                <para>In GnuCash 2.6.6, this report was modified to simplify the recording of dividend and interest payments. With this
                change it may not be necessary to include the dummy stock split in the transaction. The report will find income (and expense) transactions that are in the parent account of the stock account being reported on. This is done by looking in the parent account for transactions that have exactly two splits (not counting trading account splits) where the other split is to an income or expense account with the same name as the stock's account.
                </para>
                <para>For example given an account structure like
                </para>
                <literallayout>
                Assets (type ASSET)
                  Broker (type ASSET)
                    Widget Stock (type STOCK)
                Income (type INCOME)
                  Dividends (type INCOME)
                    Widget Stock (type INCOME)
                </literallayout>
                <para>A transaction that debits the "Assets:Broker" account and credits the "Income:Dividends:Widget Stock" account will count as income even though it doesn't have a split with account "Assets:Broker:Widget Stock".
                </para>
                <para>This only works if the parent account ("Assets:Broker" in this case) is a Bank or Asset account and the Income/Expense account has the same name as the stock account. It won't double count transactions that have a dummy split since they won't have exactly two split transactions.
                </para>
                <para>It will not work if the income or expense account split is to a subaccount of the account with the same name as the stock account i.e. "Income:Dividends:Widget Stock:Franked"

        <para>Asset Barchart:</para>

        <para>The Asset Barchart report displays bars that present the value of all assets in a
        <application>&app;</application> file over time.  By default, the report shows all accounts
        in <emphasis>Accounts Receivable</emphasis>, <emphasis>Current Assets</emphasis>,
        <emphasis>Fixed Assets</emphasis>, <emphasis>Investments</emphasis> and Special Accounts
        (if they exist) and it displays monthly bars for the current financial period. 
        This report provides a graphic view of the assets in the file over time.</para>

        <tip>
          <para>Like all the generic reports, the user can assign a title and save the report with 
          it's selected options for re-use later.</para>
        </tip>  
        
        <para>The display is in the form of either a stacked barchart or simple barchart with an 
        option to display a table of the values.</para>

        <para>This report calculates and displays a default of 8 bars or up to 24 separate asset
        accounts value at the end of the day on several dates through a specified time period.
        The report automatically selects the most significant accounts to display with all other
        selected accounts summed as <emphasis>Other</emphasis>.</para>

        <para>The report exploits the outline structure of the chart of accounts to allow the user
        to select top level accounts and sub-accounts down to a user-selectable depth.  Selected 
        sub-accounts below the selected depth are automatically <emphasis>summed up</emphasis> into
        the next level when it is also selected.  The default number of sub-account levels is 2,
        giving a summary view.  Increasing the number of sub-levels increases the detail available
        to display. It is possible to un-select a higher level account and leave sub-accounts 
        selected to force greater detail to appear in the report.</para>

        <para>By default the report includes all <emphasis>asset</emphasis> accounts and sub-accounts,
        as well as <emphasis>Imbalance</emphasis> and <emphasis>Orphan</emphasis> Special accounts
        in whatever currencies or commodities may be present. The report's base currency is the 
        default currency of the <application>&app;</application> file but if the file has data
        for multiple currencies, then it can be changed to another currency.</para>

        <para>Since each account may be individually selected, the report can be designed to focus 
        on a small subset of data such as current assets or investments.</para>

        <para>The overall interval of the report defaults to start at the start of the current 
        accounting period and to end at the end of the current accounting period. Numerous 
        other starting choices and ending choices are available.</para>

        <para>The first bar shows the selected values at the end of the day on the first date chosen.
        There are a number of choices for step size from <emphasis>day</emphasis> to 
        <emphasis>year</emphasis> with the default being <emphasis>month</emphasis>. Note that if any 
        step date would fall on the 29th, 30th or 31st in a month that does not have such a date
        the next interval will be 31 days later. For that step only the date will <emphasis>slip</emphasis>
        up to 3 days into the following month. This is true for releases at least through 2.4.13.
        Bug 639049 is open in Bugzilla to modify this behavior.</para>

        <para>Currently, there is no option to start the report on the last day of any period. 
        There is also no option to show <emphasis>beginning</emphasis> balances or <emphasis>end of 
        previous step</emphasis> balances. This makes it difficult to correlate this report to 
        business quarterly reports, for example.</para>

        <para>The Net Worth linechart report, Liability barchart report and Net Worth barchart 
        report are similar except for the graphic type and default account groups selected.</para>

       <para>Other features are customizable in a manner similar to other standard reports.</para>

        <para>Budget Report:</para>
	<para>This report is used to compare budgeted and real amounts for selected accounts. It allows you to review how well you follow the budget.</para>
	<para>The report is generated as a table in which each row represents an account and each set of columns shows the <emphasis>budgeted amount</emphasis>, the <emphasis>real amount</emphasis>, and the <emphasis>difference</emphasis> between them for each report period.</para>
	<para>Each entry in the <emphasis>real amount</emphasis> column is the sum of all the splits in the row's account over the column's period. For example, if the report is set up for monthly periods, the column is for May, and the row is for Expences:Groceries, then the value will be the sum of all Expenses:Groceries splits for that May.</para>
	<para>The report supports selecting a range of periods instead all of them. Periods that are out of range can be included in report as the consolidated columns around the selected range. This allows you to focus on particular periods, for example the current one, and is especially useful for budgets with many periods. For example, if you have a 12 period budget you can make a 3 column report with the format "(all periods before columns set) (current period columns set) (all periods after columns set)" that is easily fits on the screen and allows you to match values with account names.</para>

              suggest how to save report options E.g. Choose definite options when you
              want to see an Income Statement, so you want to save them for future and
              not to choose all the time.

                File -> Add Report   (in 2.0.5).
              But first, you must change the title of the report in the options. -->

        <para>Many reports share similar sorts of options. Some common ones include:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Report Name: Set the title of the report. This is also used to print the
             report for later viewing.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Date Options: Reports typically specify either a single date, or a date
             range, for the report. Dates can be specified in two ways, either directly
             (using the date selector), or by selecting a relative date from the menu.
             Relative dates allow you to specify dates like <guilabel>Beginning of this year</guilabel> or
             <guilabel>Today</guilabel>.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Step Size: This option is used on bar charts to determine the interval which
             each bar represents. Typical values are daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Accounts: Select the appropriate accounts for the report. Note that in some
             reports only certain types of accounts can be selected. For example, an expense
             piechart only allows expense accounts to be selected. </para>

             <note><para>This section may need updating !!!</para> </note>

        <para>It is possible to write reports if the current ones are not suitable. To do this
         you will need to know Scheme (a LISP-like programming language), and it is an
         excellent idea to have a copy of the <application>&app;</application> source code available. </para>

        <para>The reporting interface is documented in the source code file
         <filename>src/report/report-system/doc/report-html.txt</filename>. The file <filename>src/report/utility-reports/hello-world.scm</filename>
         in the <application>&app;</application> source distribution provides a good example of how reports are
         developed.</para>

        <para>It is also necessary to access data from the engine to get information for your
         report. This is performed by a set of Scheme wrapper functions that are documented in
         the file <filename>src/g-wrap/gnc.html</filename>. Examine some of the other reports in src/scm/report for
         an indication of how they are used.</para>

        <para>At present, reports are produced by calling a <acronym>HTML</acronym>-generation API, which outputs
         a dialect of <acronym>HTML</acronym> and rendering this with a <acronym>HTML</acronym> widget. This has limitations,
         particularly when trying to align objects precisely, as might be necessary for
         printing onto pre-printed invoices for example.</para>
