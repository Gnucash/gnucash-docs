    <title>Enter Transaction via register</title>

    <para>When the Account Register Window for an account is opened the list of transactions for that
    account is shown. This window has the name of the account on its tab. The menus contain several
    functions that alter the display of transactions. The <emphasis>Toolbar</emphasis> also contains several functions that are
    often used when entering or manipulating transactions. These are described in the
    <xref linkend="account-register"></xref> section of this document.</para>

    <sect2 id="trans-reg-enter">
      <title>Entering Directly in the Register Window</title>

      <para>The register window will look slightly different depending on the style options you have chosen.
      The following describes entering simple transactions in the basic ledger style. The cursor is placed
      in the <guilabel>date</guilabel> field by default when the register window is opened.</para>

      <note>
        <para>When working on transactions in <application>&app;</application>, be aware that the
        <keycap function="enter">Enter</keycap> key and the <keycap function="tab">Tab</keycap> key behave
        differently, and perform different actions.</para>
        <para>The <keycap function="enter">Enter</keycap> key moves to the first field of the next split,
        regardless of which field you are in. If there is no next split, proceeds to the next transaction.
        In any case, <keycap function="enter">Enter</keycap> finishes the transaction edit, and any
        imbalance is posted to <emphasis>Imbalance-CUR</emphasis>, where <emphasis>CUR</emphasis> is the
        currency of the transaction.</para>
        <para>The <keycap function="tab">Tab</keycap> key moves to the next field in the current split.
        If it's the last field, moves to the next split, creating a new one if there isn't one. If the
        split is blank, the <keycap function="tab">Tab</keycap> key finishes the transaction and posts any
        imbalance to <emphasis>Imbalance-CUR</emphasis>, as above.</para>

          <para>Selecting the small icon on the right of the date field drops down a date selection calendar.
          Use the arrows to select the correct month and year for the transaction then select the date.
          Selecting the icon once more will close the date selection calendar. It is also possible to
          type in the date or part of the date and let <application>&app;</application> fill the rest.</para>

          <para>Press <keycap>Tab</keycap> to move to or select the <guilabel>Num</guilabel> field. Here you can enter a check or

          name as you type.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>At this stage one of two things will happen if tab is pressed. If <application>&app;</application> matches an existing
          transaction the cursor will jump to one of the amount fields, automatically filling in the transfer
          account.  Selecting any field with the mouse instead of tabbing will not automatically fill the
          transferring account field.  If there is no matching (existing) transaction, <application>&app;</application> will move the
          cursor to the <guilabel>Transfer</guilabel> field with only one line of the transaction supplied.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para> Accounts may be selected either by typing them in or
          by pressing the small button on the right of the
          <guilabel>Transfer</guilabel> field, which will display a
          pick list of all non-placeholder accounts. Note that this pick list
          will still display hidden accounts. If you have hidden an account in
          your chart of accounts, you may want to set the account also to be
          a placeholder account so that it doesn't display here.
          </para>
          <para> When typing, <application>&app;</application> will
          fill in available accounts as you type. For example, if you
          have <emphasis>Equity</emphasis> and
          <emphasis>Expenses</emphasis> top-level accounts, typing
          <keycap>E</keycap> will fill in <emphasis
          role="bold">Equity</emphasis> because it sorts before
          <emphasis role="bold">Expenses</emphasis>. Continuing to
          type <keycap>x</keycap> will present <emphasis

          (<keycap>:</keycap> by default, see <xref
          linkend="prefs-accounts"></xref>Account Preferences about
