  <para>Este capítulo ainda não se encontra traduzido, dado que as exigências fiscais 
  em Portugal não permitem a utilização do GnuCash para gestão de pequenas empresas.</para>
  
  <para>Ficou assim a tradução adiada para mais tarde.</para>

<!--    <para>The accounting needs of a business are quite different from that of
    a person. Businesses have customers that owe money, vendors which are owed
    money, employee payroll, more complex tax laws, etc. <application>&app;</application> offers
    business oriented features to facilitate these needs.</para>

    <para>Accounts Receivable (A/R) are used by businesses to record sales for
    which they are not immediately paid. Accounts Payable (A/P) record bills
    that they have received, but might not pay until later. These types of
    accounts are used primarily when you have a lot of bills and receipts
    flowing in and out, and do not want to lose track of them just because you
    do not pay or get paid right away. For most home users, A/R and A/P are
    too complicated to be worth the effort.</para>

    <para>Accounts Receivable (or A/R) refers to products or services provided
    by your company for which payment has not yet been received. This is
    represented on the balance sheet as an asset, because the expectation is
    that you will receive payment soon.</para>

    <para>Accounts Payable (or A/P) refers to products or services bought by your 
    company for which payment has not yet been sent. This is represented on the balance sheet
    as a liability because you will have to pay for them.</para>

  <sect1 id="busnss-ar-setup1">
    <title>Initial Setup</title>

    <para>To set up <application>&app;</application> to handle accounts receivable and accounts payable 
      for a company  four preliminary things must be done. The first is to build an appropriate
      Account Hierarchy. The second is set up tax tables. The third is to register the company in
      <application>&app;</application>. The fourth is to set up billing terms.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="busnss-setupacct2">
      <title>Account Setup</title>

      <para>There are many different ways to set up a business account
      hierarchy. You can start with the Business Accounts setup which is
      available from the New Account Hierarchy assistant, or you could build one
      manually. To access the prebuilt Business Accounts, start <application>&app;</application> and
      click on <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>New File</guimenuitem></menuchoice> and
      proceed until you see the list of available accounts, select <emphasis>Business
      Accounts</emphasis>.</para>

      <note> 
        <para>The prebuilt Business Account hierarchy will not meet your needs
        exactly. You will need to make adjustments for the hierarchy to function
        well with your particular situation. It should be close enough that it
        is recommended you begin with it.</para>
      </note>

      <para>To use <application>&app;</application>&rsquo;s integrated accounts 
      payable system, you must first setup an account of the <emphasis>A/Payable</emphasis>
      type. The <emphasis>A/Payable</emphasis> account is usually a sub-account 
      under Liabilities. It is within this account that the integrated A/P system 
      places transactions.</para>

      <literallayout>
        Basic A/P Account Hierarchy:

        -Assets
          -Bank
        -Liabilities
          -Accounts Payable
        -Expenses
          -AP Expenses
      </literallayout>

     <para>You need to add additional asset accounts and real expense accounts to make 
     this hierarchy useful.  The important aspects of this hierarchy are that you need
     an expense account and an Accounts Payable account, with account type set to 
     <emphasis>A/Payable</emphasis>.</para>

            also be a Liability account (even though it will usually have a debit balance)

    <para>The default Invoice style, as shown in <xref

    <para>To add a customized background, heading banner or logo to invoices,

    button in the <guilabel>Select HTML Style Sheet</guilabel> window that will appear.</para>

    <para>Give a <guilabel>Name</guilabel> to the new style sheet (e.g. <guilabel>Custom Invoice</guilabel>) and select the

    <guilabel>General</guilabel>, <guilabel>Images</guilabel>, and <guilabel>Tables</guilabel>. The <guilabel>Colors</guilabel>
    section allows you to change the colors of various items of the invoice. The <guilabel>Fonts</guilabel> section lets you
    set fonts type and dimensions. The <guilabel>General</guilabel> section allows you to set the <guilabel>Preparer</guilabel> and
    <guilabel>Prepared for</guilabel> information, and to <guilabel>Enable Links</guilabel>. The <guilabel>Images</guilabel> section allows you
    to import graphics into the style sheet. The <guilabel>Tables</guilabel> section allows you to
    adjust the spacing around the tables which make up the invoice.</para>

    <para>To include a company logo, banner heading and background image, use
    your favorite graphics application such as <application>The Gimp</application> or <application>OpenOffice Draw</application> to
    save the images in either <acronym>GIF</acronym> or <acronym>PNG</acronym> format. Then import them into the

   <note>
      <para>The images are placed in the invoice as follows. The
      <guilabel>Background Tile</guilabel> is tiled to become the background
      image, the <guilabel>Heading Banner</guilabel> goes to above the invoice
      text, and the <guilabel>Logo</guilabel> is placed in the upper left corner
      of the invoice to the left of the Heading Banner. You will probably have
      to try a few different sized images until you get the invoices to print
      nicely. Some sizing suggestions are that the Logo should be 1 square cm
      (~0.5 inch), and the Heading Banner should be 15 cm (~6 inches) wide and 1
      cm (~0.5 inch) tall.</para>
    </note>

    <para>With the style sheet configured, when you print the invoice, you
