  <title>Setting Up, Editing &amp; Working with Accounts</title>

  <para>This section describes the process of setting up, editing and working with &app; Accounts. In &app;
    an Account is used as the basic tool to organize the recording of where money comes from and
    goes to. &app; also extends the concept of real world accounts such as a bank account or loan
    account to grouping income and expense accounts. This allows you to quickly see where you spent
    your money and what your major income and expenses are. &app; sets Account Types (as described
    in the next section) to help in organizing and grouping accounts. Account Types can be used to
    create a Chart of Accounts.

    <title>Creating a Chart of Accounts</title>

    <para>The Chart of Accounts is like a table of contents for your finances. The best way to conceptualize a
      chart of accounts is as a tree. The main branches represent entire categories or groups, while
      the leaves of the tree denote individual bank accounts or expense categories. When a summary
      report is requested, typically only the main branches are shown in the report, rather than the
      individual accounts. For example, a chart of accounts might look like the following:<xi:include href="Help_chtacctseg.xml"/>
    </para>

    <note id="accts-code">
      <title>Accounts codes</title>

      <para>Note that accounts not only have names; they may have codes, to order the accounts. When a report is
        generated, the sort order is determined by the numbering. It&rsquo;s customary to have the
        leaf accounts end in non-zero digits, while parent nodes have increasing numbers of zeros.
      </para>
    </note>

    <warning>
      <para>&app; does not prevent duplicate numbering, although we would encourage you to avoid this. Account
        codes are treated as numbers in base-36, thus, if you run out of numbers, you can use the
        letters, a through z.

    <title>Editing a Chart of Accounts</title>

    <para>Editing the Chart of Accounts is done within the <guilabel>Parent Account</guilabel> pane of the

    <title>Deleting an Account</title>

    <para></para>

    <para>Deleting an Account means removing all transaction information and information about this account
      from the file. This cannot be undone. You will be prompted to verify that you wish to remove
      the account. If the account still contains transaction information you will be warned that
      this account contains transactions.
    </para>

    <para>A side effect of removing an account that contains transactions is that you will end up with
      unbalanced accounts. This will be indicated in the account by a gray check-box next to the
      debit and credit amounts. You can automatically repair these unbalanced accounts by using the<menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Actions</guimenu><guimenuitem>Check &amp; Repair</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>menu. This will automatically assign the unbalanced amounts to a new account named
      <emphasis role="bold">Imbalance. </emphasis>

  <sect1 id="acct-reconcile">
    <title>Reconciling an Account to a Statement</title>

    <para>Reconciliation of Accounts in &app; with statements from a bank or other institution is a way of
      double checking the accuracy of your (and your banks) transactions and the balance of your
      accounts. It also is useful to track uncleared checks and other outstanding transactions.
    </para>

    <para>The reconciling process in &app; involves two dialogs: the <xref linkend="tool-reconcile" /> dialog
      followed by the <xref linkend="rec-win" /> window. They provide access to various &app;
      functions to make it easy to enter and update account information during the reconciliation.
    </para>

    <tip>
      <para>The Reconcile window is accessed from the account tree window or the account register window by
        selecting<menuchoice>

    </tip>

    <note>
      <para>If you are reconciling an Liability Account of type <guilabel>credit card</guilabel> using a credit
        card statement you have the option of using the <guilabel>Transfer Funds</guilabel> dialogue
        that opens automatically and enter a credit card payment. You can change this behaviour in
        the <guilabel>&appname; Preferences</guilabel> from the menu<menuchoice>
          <guimenu><accel>E</accel>dit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Pr<accel>e</accel>ferences</guimenuitem>

    </note>

    <para>The <emphasis>Summary Bar</emphasis> at the bottom of the Account Register Window indicates the

      <guilabel>Cleared</guilabel> (Transactions), <guilabel>Reconciled</guilabel> (Transactions)
      and <guilabel>Projected Minimum</guilabel>. Online account information can be used to mark
      which transactions the bank has processed by changing the <guilabel>R</guilabel>
      (reconciliation status) column in the register from <guilabel>n</guilabel> (new) to
      <guilabel>c</guilabel> (cleared). The bank statement is then used with the
      <guilabel>Reconcile</guilabel> window to reconcile the account which changes the
      <guilabel>R</guilabel> field to <guilabel>y</guilabel> (reconciled).

        <guilabel>Include Sub-accounts</guilabel> check-box is used if one or more subaccounts are
        used to track the account you are reconciling. The <guibutton>Enter Interest
        Payment</guibutton> button is used to add a transfer to the accounts for an interest
        payment. If selected a dialog will be displayed to add the <xref linkend="tool-ent-int" />
        to the account.
