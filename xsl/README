The gnucash-docs now use system xslt stylesheets and there are some customization files
in this directory. But only images/* contents are left to make admonition and callout graphics.

See README, AUTHORS, COPYING in the images directory for their information.

DocBook XSLT 1.0 Stylesheets repository is moved from sourceforge.net to
https://github.com/docbook/xslt10-stylesheets.



New main structure is as follows:
gnc-custom-html.xsl --- gnc-custom-common.xsl ---------- OASIS html xsl --> HTML,  CHM, EPUB -> MOBI
                     |          ^                  |
gnc-custom-pdf.xsl --           |                   ---- OASIS FO xsl --> FO -> PDF
                                |            
       ^                       common  
       |                        guimenu.xsl
   format specific              emphasis.xsl
